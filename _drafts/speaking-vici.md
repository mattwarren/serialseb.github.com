Now that you've conquered the stage, you have the jokes, and you're comfortable with the speaking experience, it's time to look at the world of conferences.

I have mixed feelings as I write this entry. I love going to conferences, they've been a big part of my personal and professional journey. All the same, they can be a difficult environment if you arrive unprepared or with the wrong idea.

notes
 - getting paid (where is that blog post?)
 - submitting
 - You are just a number
 - It attracts psychopaths because it wields power
 - the system is broken
 - the danger of fame
