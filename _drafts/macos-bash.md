In the previous chapter, I touched a bit about commands in the shell. If you're anything like me, you love your command-line, and the move to bash can be extremely challenging.

So in this chapter I have a big fat table of the things I'm discovering how to do, with the PowerShell equivalents. The goal is not to be exhaustive, but to have *just enough* to move to bash for day-to-day tasks.

I'm still absolutely terrible at this, so feel free to suggest any changes in the comments.

| What | Command | Powershell or C# |

| Enumerate only directoriy names | `ls -1d */` |
| Read line from user | `read -p "Enter text:" userline` | `Console.ReadLine()` |


| To do... | bash | Powershell |
