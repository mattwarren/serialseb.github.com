# Speaker bios
Here you can find a few bios you can use for your conference, in different styles and oriented on different aspects
of the services I offer.

## Web / ReST - short
Sebastien Lambla runs Caffeine IT, a consultancy helping clients from all over Europe implement first-grade and
nnovative solutions, from brushing up software design skills to implementing enterprise-ready resource-oriented
architectures.
In his spare time, Sebastien writes a book on ReST, contributes to OSS projects, and is still in a secret love affair
with javascript and nodejs.

## Web / ReST - long
Sebastien Lambla has been involved in software development since receiving his first web browser, back in the days of Netsape Navigator 1.2. After a few years of hacking on javascript, he turned his attention to the .net platform, on which he would spend the next few years building software in many companies.
From 2006, Sebastien has been running Caffeine IT, a consultancy helping clients from all over Europe implement first-grade and innovative solutions.
Keen Open-Source promoter, Sebastien has created multiple high-profile open-source projects that are in use in many Fortune 500 companies, including OpenRasta, at a time the most popular resource-oriented framework on .net.
Long-time advocate of the ReST architectural style and resource-oriented computing, Sebastien has delivered over the years new platforms leveraging the architecture of the web, from small independents to Fortune 500s.
