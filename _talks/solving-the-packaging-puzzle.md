title: Solving the Packaging Puzzle (with Ian Cooper)
active: false
type: workshop
summary: Have you noticed that whilst everyone is talking about package management, fewer people seem to talking about the patterns and practices of package management, what you need to do to package up your application, and how well the tools out there support that. We'll talk about the packaging principles like Common Closure and Reuse Equivalencey, afferent and efferent coupling, and what main sequence diagrams show us.
