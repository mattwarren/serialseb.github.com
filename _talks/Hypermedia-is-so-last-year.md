title:  Tuples, actions and hydras – An intro to Linked Data
summary: |
  Hypermedia and unicorns are so 2011! The next evolution in APIs on the web may well be linked data. With the recent adoption of json-ld by Google, we may finally be seeing the semantic web break into our world. We will discover, by browsing a children's book, what resources are and how they relate to one another. Don't be afraid, you will discover many mythical creatures, from  resources and tuples to json-ld, hydra, and maybe even RDF.
