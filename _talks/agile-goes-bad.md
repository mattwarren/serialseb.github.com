title: When agile goes bad
active: false
summary: |
    With applying agile methodologies comes changes in many aspects of delivering software. And with any change will
    come a time when something fails. How to keep everyone calm? How to provide practical solutions to prevent people
    from reverting back to non-agile practices at the first roadblock? Through examples gathered from personal
    experience and the community, weâ€™ll explore ways to prevent the boat from sinking at the first spilled glass of
    water.
