title: Links, forms and unicorns
summary: |
    Hypermedia is the most powerful aspect of the web, a tried and tested technology that lets you link things with
    other things. This session will start from a poorly designed, RPC-style API and evolve it by introducing links and
    forms, resulting in decreased coupling, leaner clients and happier users.
