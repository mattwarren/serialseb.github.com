    So, you've written some code and you really don't want to bother with the fame, skinny jeans don't fit you or you
    just don't want to deal with those pesky users.
    In this session, and based on nearly a decade of open-source experience, I'll
    give you a few simple steps to follow to make sure no one uses your software, no one helps you build it and it never
    ever becomes a success.
