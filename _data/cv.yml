summary: |
  I'm Sebastien. I've been involved in software development since the days of Netscape 1.1, when I wrote my first HTML page.

  Keen open-source advocate and contributor, I'm also a ReST proponent, long-time agilist, distributed systems addicionado, and involved in all things .net.

  I speak fluent French, which is not surprising for someone born in France, but don't worry, my English is as good as it gets. I love long walks on the beach, if I have to think about javascript.

  Learning and sharing is fundamental to what I do, so I give lots of talks and attend many conferences. Feel free to check that out if you want to delve in the specifics of what I'm on about.

  I've not met you, and this is crazy, but there's my number below, so call me maybe?
