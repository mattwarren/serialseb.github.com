   <p>
      <a href="http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2004/7/22#23:45">Edd</a> just launched the
      DOAP project, to define an RDF based description language for software projects. I
      have to wonder though, how specific is that to open source, and can&rsquo;t it be
      applied equally to any closed source application? &#160;
