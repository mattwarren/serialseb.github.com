      I was looking at the automatic trackback notification in dasBlog today, and received
      a weird referral from google.

      That&rsquo;s right ladies and gentlemen, your dear technologist is the <b>first result</b> on
      a search for marketing bullshit. Now I can understand better why google is fucked
      up. (Does that means that I&rsquo;ll end up first on a search for google marketing?
      I hope so!)

      Few posts on by backlog, two very very big ones, one rant that I prefer to take time
      writing. New stuff coming!
