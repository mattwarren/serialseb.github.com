      <a href="http://radio.javaranch.com/channel/val/2004/07/13/1089700841000.html">Val</a> does
      a good job of summarizing of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/06/29/169394.aspx">discussion
      Eric started</a> on AOP and Microsoft technologies, and I thought I would add a bit
      more to the discussion. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Jeroen in the comments say that Microsoft is watching what the industry does in AOP&hellip;
      But to be really honest, Microsoft was one of the first in the industry to provide
      interception and decoration of code with its COM+ Services. You can ask <a href="http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/">Clemens</a> about
      his experience hooking up in this COM+ pipeline! (I was looking for posts about it,
      not sure he ever put down on the net what he explained in one conference I was at
      in Paris). 
   </p>
   <p>
      Moreover, I think it&rsquo;s fair enough to say that the interception layer has been
      implemented in the .net world, through the use of the TransparentProxy / RealProxy
      couple. What prevents that from being used more efficiently? It&rsquo;s as slow as
      it gets. It needs a context on its own. <i>Some people</i> (I&rsquo;m not putting
      names as I can&rsquo;t assert for sure, but I have my opinion on the matter) pushed
      to have call contexts instead of object instances contexts, which results in it not
      to be optimized before .net 3 or 4, maybe (according to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2003/07/14/51495.aspx">this
      guy which should known what he&rsquo;s talking about</a>). And that&rsquo;s a shame.
