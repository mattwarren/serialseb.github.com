title: Something's wrong with SauceReader
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      Today I checked my soon to be disconnected blog (although a friend of mine might be
      able to host it while I move), and was very happy to see more than the usual number
      of connections. Actually, twice a bigger number. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Then I looked at the user agent strings&hellip; And saw that: 
   </p>
   <table class="MsoTableGrid" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" style='border-collapse:collapse;border:none'>
      <tr>
         <td width="491" valign="top" style='width:368.6pt;border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt'>
            <p>
               Sauce Reader/1.7 (.NET CLR 1.1.4322.573; WinNT 5.0.2195.0) 
            </p>
         </td>
         <td width="99" valign="top" style='width:74.2pt;border:solid windowtext 1.0pt; border-left:none;padding:0cm 5.4pt 0cm 5.4pt'>
            <p align="right" style='text-align:right'>
               <span style=''>1269</span> 
            </p>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </table>
   <p>
      So now there&rsquo;s something weird. Either Sauce Reader is hammering my feed more
      than other clients. Or, there is another explanation that I&rsquo;m not aware of.
      Anyone got an idea? 
   </p>
