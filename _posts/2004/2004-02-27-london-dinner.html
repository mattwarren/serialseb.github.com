      restaurant, was nice seeing Ian and Benjamin again. Lots of talk with Katja and Daniel
      about dogs and cats while Ingo and Ben were talking about these awful technologies
      (you know, SOA, remoting&#8230;). Don&#8217;t know how they could after so many bottles
      of Cabernet Sauvignon Merlot 1999&#8230; I think it was 5, and the next day everybody
      had a hard time in the morning. But it was definitely worth it.<o:p></o:p>
