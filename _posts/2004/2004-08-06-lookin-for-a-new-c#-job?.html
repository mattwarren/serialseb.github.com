   Are you an experienced highly technical C# developer?
</p>
<p>
   If you are, let me know, as my agency is looking for people to place into highly rated
   companies with great salaries. They did a great job for me, they can do a great job
   for you. So if you want to be placed in a very successful company, just forward me
   your cv by email, sebastien.lambla AT bouygtel.fr, and you could be just minutes away
   from your dream job!
