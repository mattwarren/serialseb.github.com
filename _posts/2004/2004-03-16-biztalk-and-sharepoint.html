      <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jan/">Jan <span class="SpellE">Tielens</span></a> is
      really getting me hot on these two servers, and if I get some time I need to dig into
      them. Question to all of you, why isn&rsquo;t Microsoft targeting architects more
      about their server products? They look from where I am as very interesting niche things
      that can&rsquo;t really help me&hellip; <span class="GramE">A bit like ADAM or active
      directory.</span> I know they are there, I know I&rsquo;m constantly rewriting whatever
      is in there to provide my own solution, but at the end, I have no authoritative voice
      as to if I should rely upon these packaged software pieces.&#160;
