title: A hidden new feature in Service Pack 2
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      Just noticed while doing some clean-up work (as my machine seems to have gotten into
      some kind of neurotic reboot sequence&hellip;) that there is something new in the
      Add/Remove control panel&hellip; 
   </p>
   <p>
      You can now click on &ldquo;show updates&rdquo; and it will show you the patches that
      were previously hidden. For example, XP Service pack 2 is put under &ldquo;Windows
      XP &ndash; Software Updates&rdquo;. How cool is that? 
   </p>
   <p>
      Now my question is, how do you get the installer to know about that? 
   </p>
