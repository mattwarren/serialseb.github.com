title: Back to blogging, already?

<p>
   <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #003300; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />Ok,
   I'll admit it... I have a hard time not blogging at all!<o:p></o:p>
   </span>
</p>
<p>
   <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #003300; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">I spent the last
   few days talking with many people, both internally and externally. For the moment,
   I'm resuming my blogging as usual, and will talk to all the non Morgan Stanley specific
   stuff. I'll add a disclaimer soon to my web site though.<o:p></o:p>
   </span>

<p>
   <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #003300; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Should I adopt
   the stance of not mentioning which company I'm working for? I think it would be disrespectful
   of both my readers and myself. I'm proud to be an IT guy working in Morgan Stanley,
   and I wouldn't do myself a favor by hiding that. Moreover, it's a great place, and
   the public has the right to know!<o:p></o:p>

   <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #003300; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana">Is it risky? Yes,
   a bit more than the usual rambling. If one of the lawyers somewhere becomes mad at
   me for blogging, I could loose my job. But is it worth it? I think it is, both for
   Morgan and for me. I've been around the blogging world for two years now (that goes
   fast doesn't it?) and I'm not going to go away anytime soon. I love my job, and I
   don't think I'll go away from there either.<o:p></o:p>

   your aggregator off and resume a normal activity. Thanks.</span>
