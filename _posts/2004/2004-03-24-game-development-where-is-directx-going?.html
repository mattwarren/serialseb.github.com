title: Game Development, where is directX going?
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      From <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/2004/03/24/news_6092082.html">gamespot</a>,
      Microsoft announced a new toolkit that would work across Microsoft platforms to develop
      games. I can certainly understand that the scope is far bigger than just directX technologies,
      but how is that going to merge into the developer toolkit? And will we ever see an
      official way to let homebrew software running on .net work on an Xbox console? 
   </p>
   <p>
      One last question, I&rsquo;ve still not heard of WinFS relations to gaming&hellip;
      I strongly think that a winfs store for game &ldquo;saves&rdquo; is going to provide
      for a great way to manage game sessions, be it on a usb memory card, or on your hard
      drive. How will it be possible, through one development platform, to target the full
      power of winfs, some subset of it on Xbox2, and the nothing we have on winNTx?

      I know, I&rsquo;m asking too many questions :)
