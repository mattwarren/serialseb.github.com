      dasBlonde is <a href="http://www.dasblonde.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=df113dbc-a7b3-43b2-88aa-95281177461e">blogging</a> about
      the GetHashCode vs GetCurrentThreadId way of getting a thread id. Without knowing
      what exactly she is trying to accomplish, it seems to me that GetHashCode shouldn&rsquo;t
      be used in the same way as the GetCurrentThreadId.

      If you&rsquo;re trying to get the <b>logical thread id</b>, GetCurrentThreadId gives
      you that, and you can rely on it to be stable for the lifetime of your process. Very
      useful for tracking code execution path for example.
   </p>
   <p>
      GetHashCode on the other hand gives you something else (from the MSDN documentation):
   </p>
   <div style='border:solid blue 1.0pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt'>
      <p style='border:none;padding:0cm'>
         Serves as a hash function for a particular type, suitable for use in hashing algorithms
         and data structures like a hash table.
      </p>

      Thanks to my huge pst file, newsgator, my memory still working well and my paranoid
      archiving of everything, notice <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/BradA/permalink.aspx/b96ccc7e-21b4-4d55-b404-16bf267d5ee4">this
      post</a>. What does it tells us? That the contract on the GetHashCode method is to
      provide a reasonably random value, but that <b>could be negative or duplicated for
      multiple values</b>. The guarantee is even getting weaker (or the lack of getting
      stronger) in v2.
   </p>
   <p>
      What else can we know about the GetHashCode functionality defined on the <i>Object</i> class?
      I had a nice email chat with Brian Grunkemeyer back in October, and I actually learnt
      something that I didn&rsquo;t foresee: <b>A hashcode can be duplicated (it is non
      unique) AND it may change during the lifetime of an object, no guarantee is made.</b> I
      quote him here (hope he doesn&rsquo;t mind):
   </p>
   <div style='border:solid blue 1.0pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt'>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style='border:none;padding:0cm'>
         <span style='font-size:10.0pt; font-family:Arial;color:navy'>String has always used
         a hash function that could generate repeatable values &ndash; Object's implement of
         GetHashCode was the one that didn't generate repeatable values (for the lifetime of
         a given object).&#160; Now this repeatability isn't a problem &ndash; any well written
         hash table expects collisions in a bucket and has to do an equality check on the two
         objects first, using Object::Equals(Object) or an equality method provided by another
         comparison interface, like IComparer.&#160; So normal hashing shouldn't be affected
         by this.&#160;</span>
      </p>
   </div>
   <p>
      There you go. GetHashCode has a pretty weak contract that suits mostly the developers
      of the Hashtable, full stop. Thread Id on the other hand gives you the guarantee that
      your thread id is going to be unique to this thread. Just imagine if two threads were
      sharing the same Id? Thread Id collision would be a real disaster!
   </p>
   <p>
      And finally, to complete this post with yet another API (what wouldn&rsquo;t anyone
      do to take over the first google return from .net247!), the Process.Threads return
      ProcessThread objects which do have ThreadId. As <a href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/cbrumme/permalink.aspx/9fd9222c-ee65-424d-867e-8e4e52ea394b">this
      post</a> from Chris Brumme explains, u shouldn&rsquo;t ever rely on that at all, as
      the CLR is actually &ldquo;virtualizing&rdquo; the OS threads, and you may also encounter
      the garbage collection thread, and additional internal CLR threads&hellip;
