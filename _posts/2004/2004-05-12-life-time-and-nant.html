<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      It&rsquo;s already been two weeks since I posted anything. We&rsquo;re in beta release
      of the software I&rsquo;ve been working on for nearly a year now (on the 19<sup>th</sup> of
      May to be exact) for my company, Cubiks Ltd. (web site at <a href="http://www.cubiks.com/">www.cubiks.com</a>).
      By linking to them, is my googlejuice gonna take over the first hit in google? Time
      will tell. Anyway, not much time between coding, changing my life throughout hopefully
      for the better, and rebuilding all the things I took for granted for the last three
      years. Getting yourself together is an on going job, and by not doing it earlier I
      pay the price now. 
   </p>
   <p>
      List of things in the pipeline:

      I&rsquo;m finally back at coding it, we&rsquo;re preparing a lot of great stuff over
      there. Thanks to Mark, which I can really call a friend for always being with me,
      behind me and supporting me through all these years (yes mate, it&rsquo;s already
      been years!)

      this top secret product I&rsquo;ve been working on alone for a full year and that
      starts being usable and manageable.

      top secret project: Distributed garbage collection for .net, or how to enable garbage
      collection tracking of your objects in an automatic way across AppDomains (at first,
      I&rsquo;ll go cross process later on). Lot of technology here, reflection, codeDOM,
      remoting, multithreading, etc. I&rsquo;ll try to integrate it, once finished, with
      Roy&rsquo;s <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2003/11/24/39484.aspx">Extensibility
      Application Block</a> to leverage his work, and will try to produce an article from
      it. <i>Side note, anyone wanting me to write about a specific subject for a publication,
      please let me know, I can now allocate enough time to do it and would love to get
      back to writing.</i>

      to build, or rather How I build a NAnt based fully automated build system with SourceGear
      Vault, and how that helps the development team around me (well, <b><i>should</i></b>)
      will be something I&rsquo;ll write as I&rsquo;m head up in NAnt these days.

      would be my best nick, and as such, am spending a lot of time at the <a href="http://www.centralymca.org.uk/">YMCA</a> to
      try and get in shape. Already lost 7 kilos in 4 to 5 weeks, and the difference is <b>really</b> stunning
      (to me at least).

      sorry to <a href="http://jazbee.int.webmatrixhosting.net/">Julien Brunet</a> for falling
      behind on helping him translating his articles. I spent a long time trying to cope
      with it all, and just couldn&rsquo;t. I should&rsquo;ve been more open about that.
      Sorry buddy, I promise I&rsquo;ll pay you back on that one.

      and putting data on an internal Wiki (after the failure of trying to push people to
      blog internally). I love it, but it is so limitating that I may end up, if I ever
      get the time, rewriting one from scratch. Julien, interested into developing a distributed
      web services based SOA best of the cream architecture Wiki/blog/rss aggregation with
      an associated windows version, etc? :-)

      for a new job. I&rsquo;m staying at Cubiks for how long it will take to get our product
      out of the door, but we&rsquo;ve reached a point where both parties can&rsquo;t properly
      use each others resources, so I need to move on. I still feel a lot of deception that
      it didn&rsquo;t work out for the best,&#160; but sometimes requirements change, on
      both sides, and it just doesn&rsquo;t work out anymore. Oh well&hellip; If you hear
      about a technical architect or a technologist position somewhere in London, drop me
      a mail ! :)

      finally, still working out ideas on a book I want to write. It&rsquo;s still a very
      movable target but we&rsquo;ll get to it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Bit busy as you can see, but I&rsquo;ll try to be more reactive and more involved
      in the coming weeks. It can only get better anyway! Right?
