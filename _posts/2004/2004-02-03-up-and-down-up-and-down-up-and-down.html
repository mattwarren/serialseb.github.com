      Please bear with me while the server is going up and down, I&#8217;m far from being
      an accomplished network administrator. Moreover, my hardware sucks, I&#8217;m ashamed
      of publishing the specs of my new box. I&#8217;m too cheap to get proper hardware&#8230;
      Shame for an IT guy uh?&#160;

      By the way, I just reactivated the old URL, http://thetechnologist.is-a-geek.com/blog/.

      If you&#8217;re still subscribed to the old address, sorry I completely forgot to
      reactivate you guys. You can now switch to the much cleaner http://blog.thetechnologist.net

      Thanks for your patience.
