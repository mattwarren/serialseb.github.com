   As you probably know by now, i joined morgan stanley last monday. The work is really
   interesting, and I would lie if I was to tell you i'm not already learning at a much
   faster pace than usual.
</p>
<p>
   But as you can probably see, my blogging is less frequent. Why? Less time of course,
   although plenty of side projects are still running. The main reason is that I'd like
   to focus on blogging about some of the great stuff we're doing. After looking for
   a long time, on google and other search engines, I didn't find any other official
   morgan stanley bloggers. Why? Are you out there?
</p>
<p>
   The point is, before i can feel confident about my blogging, I need to see where I
   stand and where my company stands. This takes time, and hopefully we'll get there.
   In the meantime, I'll post a bit less. But if you're a morgan stanley employee wanting
   to start a blog, internally or on the web, or if you already blog, please contact
   me. I'm not disclosing too much by saying that exciting things <b>could</b> happen.
   So contact me, lamblas on our corporate intranet, and lamblas on jam.
</p>
<p>
   And of course, if you wanna join morgan stanley as a developer, architect, infrastructure
   guy or whatever, please come to me. My email is still sebastien.lamblaATNOSPAMbouygtel.fr.
