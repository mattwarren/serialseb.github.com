<div class=Section1>
   <p>
      This is something that has been running around for a few days but the blogosphere
      didn&#8217;t notice. You <b>can enable the desktop composition engine</b> in the post
      PDC build.
   </p>
   <p>
      Just type in a command line:
   </p>
   <p>
      C:\windows\I386\SBCtl.exe dcestart<br>
      C:\windows\I386\SBCtl.exe wmgstart
   </p>
   <p>
      Have fun! (note we're talking about the 4052 builds that were leaked on the net a
      while ago...)
