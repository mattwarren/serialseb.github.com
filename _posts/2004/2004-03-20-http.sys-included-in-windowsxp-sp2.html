   <p>
      From <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-03-20T02:15:56Z">Don</a>,
      it seems the SP2 includes http.sys. This is the kernel http driver that is included
      in windows server 2003. Now a question for don or the others: 
   </p>
   <p>
      Does it mean that the indigo stack actually hook up in http.sys instead of relying
      on IIS?&#160;
