   <p>
      I am very happy to say that I went over the 4K+ messages in my backlog in only 3 days
      of relatively painful reading, and my backlog stopped at 317 entries to think about
      or blog about. I&rsquo;ll be back to serious blogging soon. And hopefully, more reactive
      as well!&#160;

      As a side note, I&rsquo;m now officially open to suggestions for new development /
      architecture positions in London in the next few weeks/months. You know where to contact
      me. (psssssssssst, look at the mail icon, lower right of the web site!)
