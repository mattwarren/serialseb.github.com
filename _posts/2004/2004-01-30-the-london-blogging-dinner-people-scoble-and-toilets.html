title: The london blogging dinner - People, Scoble and Toilets
---

<div class=Section1>
   <p>
      So we had a blogging dinner. I was there, very good moment, nice beer, some very nice
      people, and overall nice conversation. 
   </p>
   <p>
      We talked about the dinner <a href="http://blog.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/e964a384-2b8e-47f5-8490-6cbcf055182e">here</a>,
      it was advertised by <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-01-24T08:41:06Z">Don</a> and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/01/23.html#a6350">Scoble</a>,
      and a list of some bloggers that were there was posted by chris right <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/fdb20fc3-57ea-4275-bacc-85a4116b8e8c">here</a>.
      Yes, I&#8217;m in the link list, thanks Chris <span style="FONT-FAMILY: Wingdings">J</span> 
   </p>
   <p>
      <a href="http://benjaminm.net/">Benjamin</a> is a very nice guy, even knew me by my
      name (someone told him or he&#8217;s part of the big conspiracy to prevent me from
      ruling the world with the universal blogging tool I have yet to invent. One blog to
      rule them all&#8230;). &#8216;Nuff said. Oh, by the way, he&#8217;s a Microsoft Regional
      Director, that rocks :) 
   </p>
   <p>
      Worth mentioning, <a href="http://www.clarkezone.net/">James moblogging</a> where
      you can see <a href="http://www.clarkezone.net/commentview.aspx?id=0384ef9f-ac0f-4bdf-a694-758ccc0afc9c">me</a>, <a href="http://www.clarkezone.net/commentview.aspx?id=8627c0b7-e6ca-454b-ae61-929ea76a6f9b">Chris
      sitting next to Julien</a> (so in front of me for those of you not following tss tss
      tss) . 
   </p>
   <p>
      IanG and <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">his highly graphical blog</a> here
      was there as well, also I must admit that if he was there, not knowing what he looks
      like, I wouldn&#8217;t have recognized him. No Ian, <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/01/27/obblog">you&#8217;re
      not the last one</a> blogging about it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Let&#8217;s move on to <a href="http://markiwaszko.blogspot.com/">Mark</a> Iwazsco,
      to which, interestingly enough, I&#8217;ll come back on my scoble post later today.
      His<a href="http://markiwaszko.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_markiwaszko_archive.html#107521039066319528"> entry</a> resumes
      quite well the discussion we had at the restaurant, although I may add that if you&#8217;re
      looking for directX 10 and it&#8217;s new memory architecture, it&#8217;s <a href="http://gamespot.com/gamespot/stories/news/0,10870,2912498,00.html">here</a> (need
      to test the link from home thanks to the wonderful websense technology). On that note,
      it turns out DirectX v.Next is &#8220;owned&#8221; by the Avalon team, so it should
      prove to be quite interesting what kind of benefits you would get from a tighter relationship
      between the two technologies. As a side note, the exuberant French would be me. At
      least people remember me! I must say though that I tried to have a conversation with
      these two guys, and when objecting on remoting scalability and the dangers of relying
      on a remoting specific toolkit for Delphi (<a href="http://www.remobjects.com/">http://www.remobjects.com/</a>)
      the discussion switched to something else, without any apparent or implicit will for
      me to share it. So I switched to the other side of the table, where I felt more comfortable
      discussing things. Sorry guys if the discussion didn&#8217;t get any further might
      have been a misinterpretation on both sides.
