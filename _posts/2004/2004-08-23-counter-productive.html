   I am so used to outlook and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com">newsgator</a>, with
   my dasBlog plug-in, that I find it very difficult to blog from the web. The interface
   sucks, I like smart clients, not web applications trying to look like smart clients.
   No spell checker (or you need yet another piece of software), so save and edit later,
   nothing...
</p>
<p>
   And reading blogs in RSS bandit is just cumbersome. I loose a lot of time, don't have
   a nice overview of all the posts that are to read, can't edit from there. I like the
   comments and trackbacks integrated features though. Oh and the synchronization support
   is really good.
</p>
<p>
   As such, I am working on hijacking newsgator with an rss bandit compatible (hopefully)
   synchronization service, and an add-in for comments feeds and automatic conversion
   of items across feeds (something I asked <a href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/">Greg </a>about
   early in the 2.0 beta release, but it didn't happen...)

   Greg, you don't mind me playing with your internal API do you? :-)
