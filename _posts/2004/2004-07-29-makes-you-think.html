      An interesting reading (again) from <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">Paul
      Graham</a>. He&rsquo;s the guy that wrote about the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">hundred
      year language</a>, invented the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html">Bayesian
      filtering</a>, or associates <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,63506,00.html">art
      and coding</a>.

      I have one comment though&hellip; I know a lot of hackers that spend their time on
      NT boxes, and it&rsquo;s as geeky to know about how a thread goes into kernel mode
      to pass process boundary in out of process COM activation when using EntrepriseServices
      than it is to know how an X server works under *nix. That&rsquo;s my opinion anyway!
