      In his post, <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/seichert/archive/2004/02/26/8038.aspx">Steve
      Eichert</a> talks about whether objects used in SOA may or may not contain behavior.
      I&rsquo;m just reproducing the comment I was nearly going to make on his post:
   </p>
   <p>
      It seems to me that this debate is absolutely wrong in the first place. You don't
      pass OBJECTS around in a SOA architecture, so questioning whether behavior must or
      must not be included is absolutely faulty. As a matter of fact, because objects are
      used on the inside boundary, you can use them or not, with behavior or not, and you
      can even use batch scripts to execute something on your message. That&rsquo;s right,
      nothing prevents that.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you do use objects on the back end to "map" your messages, then certainly you can
      include whatever you want in them. This is an implementation detail on the inside
      frontier of your SOA, it is not a valid architecture question.
   </p>
   <p>
      But this doesn&rsquo;t really answer any question. The fact is, are we tightly coupled
      inside the service? Yes, we use types, version binding, in a .net environment. Whatever
      we do, the inside boundary of the service is extremely tightly coupled compared to
      the outside. But as always, doesn&rsquo;t mean you don&rsquo;t have to be layered
      and as loosely coupled as possible in the inside.
