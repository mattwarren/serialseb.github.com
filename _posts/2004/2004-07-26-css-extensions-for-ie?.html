title: CSS extensions for IE?
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      Just found this link: <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/">http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/</a> named
      IE7: a simple extension that makes the most useful CSS extensions available. Doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to correct some of the box model bugs though, but fix the png transparency issue.
      Oh well, it&rsquo;s a good start.

   <p>
      Might be a good way to extend ie for standard compliance, why doesn&rsquo;t Microsoft
      help with that&hellip; Provide a supported behavior that corrects all the bugs and
      missing features of ie6? That would not break current pages and provide webmasters
      with a low cost solution. In the meantime, I will continue to standardize on mozilla,
      and fix ie rendering afterwards.
