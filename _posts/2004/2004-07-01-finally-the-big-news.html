      Finally, I can speak about this big news. Here you go: 
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>3:30:</b> received copy of the offer letter by fax 
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>4:30:</b> meeting with my line management announcing I&rsquo;m resigning 
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>4:35</b>: out of the meeting 
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>5:10:</b> Relieved, sad and joyful at the&#160;same time&hellip; 
   </p>
   <p>
      Hope fully it will end up that way: 
   </p>
   <p>
      2<sup>nd</sup> of August: Me joining a very <b>very</b> well known company, and I
      must say I&rsquo;m <b>very</b> proud and happy to join the people I met over the last
      month.
