title: The best tool for outlook

<div class="Section1">

      Well, I&rsquo;ve been testing Lookout for quite some time now, and I must recognize
      that&rsquo;s one of the best tool I&rsquo;ve used. When like me you&rsquo;re an archive
      junkie, you have a tendency to have <b>huge</b> pst files. And when I say huge, I
      really mean HUGE. With Lookout, I can search all my post archive whenever I blog about
      something. Invaluable. And it can also index your documents. This is an absolute must
      have.

      The Lookout web site <a href="http://www.lookoutsoft.com/">here</a>.&#160;From <a href="http://www.clarkezone.net/default.aspx?id=5670c128-c1a0-4300-8811-f2416e1b7ef4">James</a> from <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/02/29.html#a6730">Scoble</a>.
      I cannot stress how huge this tool is. Especially when used with <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/">newsgator</a>.
