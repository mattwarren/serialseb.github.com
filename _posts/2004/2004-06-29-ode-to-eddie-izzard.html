      I have to agree with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2004/06/21/161118.aspx">Cyrus</a> on
      that one&hellip; I fell in love with this comedian a few weeks ago, with the <b>sexy</b> show&hellip;
      It is so damn fantastic.

      And notice how when he dresses up as a woman, he&rsquo;s neither man nor woman, can&rsquo;t
      call it a drag queen or a proper transvestite either&hellip; He&rsquo;s redefining
      it by wearing heels. That&rsquo;s what I call a genius!&#160;
