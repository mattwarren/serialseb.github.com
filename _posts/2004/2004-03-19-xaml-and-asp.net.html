   I wanted to blog about it for a while, but i just found one of the things i wrote
   on the longhorn newsgroups (yes, I will return to newsgroups starting next week).
   Reproduced here. Parts I edited are in between [].
</p>
<p>
   As you probably can guess, it is far from being THAT simple, and would in fact require
   a common top technology from which targetted content could be deployed. Asp.net surely
   enough have the flexibility to provide that, so does Avalon. And I know someone very
   intelligent on the net likes this idea, so it validates my point.

   Also note that because of the custom device renderers included in asp.net, it [should]
   be possible to serve nearly transparently XAML data from an asp.net page.

   That sounds interesting, Sebastien. Care to elaborate?

   Well, I didn't investigate the feasibility fully yet, which should only be next week,
   but:
</p>
<p>
   ASP.net support the idea of web controls using device renderers to intelligently render
   content to any format. As it goes, it should be possible to target completely different
   languages, like SVG or XAML, from the control. I could even go as far as saying there's
   nothing preventing, AFAIK, pure code being generated, but that would be a pain to
   code.
</p>
<p>
   Now, using this adapter, it is possible to target XAML, and provide a rich XAML based
   rendering technology on top of the ASP.net controls, and effectively switch automatically
   from HTML to XAML rendering.
</p>
<p>
   Now there are a few limitations: 1. Internet exlorer doesn't compile on the fly. This
   should definitly be resolved by using SSE, compile on run time on the client side
   and analyze security on the fly, for embed code. This pauses the same problem as scripting
   languages. IMO, the correct way to do it would be either of the following:
</p>
<p>
   XAML is generated from the ASP.net controls, but has a contract with the code behind
   that can be pre compiled by the developer and loaded in real time over the wire for
   execution. SSE plays its role there too.
</p>
<p>
   Avalon/ASP.net compatible controls, where the control can either work on the server
   side like asp.net controls, providing for an adapter based system to render to cHTML,
   xHTML, WML, etc, and that can be downloaded in real time as compiled XAML, executed
   on the client to provide for more avalon like features (3d, etc). What I'm talking
   about here is a full merge between web based and windows based controls, for the goal
   of defining one interface, and have it execute seemlessly as a compiled application,
   a web application and an http exe. Without the associated problems.
</p>
<p>
   2. Internet explorer doesn't have, as of now, integrated namespace dependent rendering
   support. What I'm talking about is what I told Don Box a few months / weeks ago: Instead
   of parsing XML data to simply initialize the object model, provide for different XAML
   controls based on the namespace. I'm getting confusing there. let's say (pseudo xml): <pre>

<xaml xmlns="schemas-xaml" xmlns:wordml="schemas-wordml>
<control>
<wordML:TextBox />
</control>
</xaml>
</pre>
In here, the control is a serialization of a xaml control, including a child
content being a word textbox control. What happens here is that the
navigator should, depending on the namespace ownership of the element,
delegate the rendering to a custom control, that should be installed as a
plug-in. But instead of going through the current mapping, you implicitly
accept two things:
<ul>
<li>The XAML code should be able to be distributed as a plain XAML file, and
only the code behind being compiled.</li>
<li>The redirection accepts the namespace definition. As an extra bonus, you
get a way to cancel the versionning by namespace problem in the current
infoset.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
How would that work:<br />
Publish your plug-in as a ClickOnce component being able to deploy and
update remotely. Register it as the manager for a namespace. Whenever you
start rendering, ask for each plug-in what to do, how to render,
recursively. Unknown tags should be treated as embed data for the parent
container. This would be a fully new internet navigator, capable of handling
any kind of documents in a much more powerfull way than plug-ins. Obviously,
solution described in 1) can be reused. And you keep the whole concept of
XAML, the object model to xml serialization handling everything.
</p><p>
There's a whole lot of work to do on merging all these control technologies
together, to provide one mutli purpose api, powerfull enough (at least a
subset) to handle both web and windows applications.
</p><p>
Oh, uh, yeah, if you want to know more, please send me my contract as soon
as possible, there's not much time left to work on that for longhorn. lol
