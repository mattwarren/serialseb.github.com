   Just read from <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/08/21.html#a8125">Scoble </a>that <a href="http://www.ysearchblog.com/archives/000012.html">Yahoo
   search team </a>starts blogging... There's always a start, but this one looks like
   a PR announcement. Let's hope they get better in the next few days.

   Have you noticed how much a lot of corporate blogs actually are PR announcement mailing
   lists using RSS feeds? The corporate world has a world collision shock to do if it
