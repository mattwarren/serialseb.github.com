title: A valuable reason for ATOM

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      My brain has been wondering around lately, about how feeds and syndication can play
      with the whole service oriented paradigm and the GXA stack.
   </p>
   <p>
      There are really two worlds in the blogging community: The simplistics and the technologists.
   </p>
   <p>
      For the <b>simplistics</b> (yes the word is mine, invented by shuffling letters around
      in something that looks readable. I should fill a patent for that word), RSS works
      and blogs work because they are technically simple (remember, <b>Really Simple</b> Syndication).
      A feed is easily written, easily read (even without an aggregator), and doesn&rsquo;t
      require much.
   </p>
   <p>
      For the <b>technologists</b>, blog-related technologies are limited and the kind of
      functionality we could bring to people is inherently limited by the technology we&rsquo;re
      using. Scoble says constantly that RSS is so much better than the web. Reality is,
      syndication still relies on a very web like interaction; only the client side of things
      you <b>see</b> and <b>use</b> is simpler and more productive.
   </p>
   <p>
      You could&rsquo;ve guessed by now that I&rsquo;m in the second category. But is the
      first category really right anyway? Let&rsquo;s see the technologies around the RSS
      format:
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> MetaWebLog
      API. XML-RPC based, which I don&rsquo;t consider a simple format, and that have its
      shares of interoperability issues.
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Trackback,
      Ping&hellip; Not complex in the way they work, but still complex concepts to adopt
      from a web perspective.
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Vocabulary,
      which includes pings, trackbacks, permalinks, etc. Is this vocabulary simple? Does
      my mother understand <b>anything to it</b>?
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span> Are
      we leveraging the underlying tool? REST-based APIs are not used, http content negotiation
      is not either. And we&rsquo;re, once again, stuck into HTTP. It might be a coacroach,
      but you know what, I wouldn&rsquo;t ride it for a competition.
   </p>
   <p>
      We&rsquo;re seeing a big paradigm shift (once again) to Services and SOAP. Is RSS
      leveraged? Surely enough it could, you can always chunk arbitrary XML within a SOAP
      envelope. So why the title, am I advocating RSS now? Hear me my friend, It&rsquo;s
      not at all my point. The actual <b>format</b> of the &lt;item&gt;, I couldn&rsquo;t
      care less. <b>RSS is not what matters</b>. With XSL-T widely available, at most I
      would prefer a format with full type fidelity that I can turn into whatever I want
      depending on what the subscriber consumes (remember, <b>content negotiation</b>&hellip;).
   </p>
   <p>
      I am advocating ATOM not as a file format, but as a process that should look at the
      overall infrastructure, and define best practices, just like how Trackback, Ping and
      other ad-hoc technologies developed themselves. Not through boards, not through committees,
      but through open work and interoperability testing. What should ATOM do?
   </p>

      WS-Security to provide authentication of a feed author. If I receive content from
      Scoble, that&rsquo;s one thing. If I receive a stock alert from Bloomberg, that&rsquo;s
      another thing.

      WS-Eventing and al. Having clouds is alright, but please, XML-RPC is dead, for god&rsquo;s
      sake let it REST in peace.

      MTOM. Enclosures are good, but MTOM solves the same problem in a service oriented
      way.

      WS-Federation for comments and to find a way to solve comment spam
   </p>
   <p>
      We have the underlying pipe technology, we lack the proper binding to a new service
      oriented world for blogs and content management in general.
   </p>
   <p>
      I can hear people screaming, so many technologies to handle, this is going to be over
      complex and won&rsquo;t ever get implemented. Remember, any market consolidates, any
      market gets fewer players, and competition is driven by how you can provide your users
      with the greatest flexibility. You don&rsquo;t write the API for MTOM or WS-Security,
      it&rsquo;s already there (ok, not MTOM, but you get the point), just like you don&rsquo;t
      reimplement the full XML-RPC stack each time you need it in one of your projects.
      The effort does gives you things the current state of technology cannot:

      more than just text with enclosures. Leverage your architecture as a content delivery

   </p>
   <p>
      ATOM is not pushing forward these ideas (which were at the origin the ones that were
      discussed), and ends up just mistaking RSS as an <b>architecture</b> when it is only
      a <b>format</b>.
