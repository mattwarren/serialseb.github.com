      Today, Smon <a href="http://www.pocketsoap.com/weblog/2004/02/1417.html">asks</a> why
      isn&rsquo;t the ~ operator is not defined for the byte type. It is the exact same
      problem for the bitshift operators (&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;). What&rsquo;s the official
      rationale? That it doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, as the processor is faster doing
      these operations on 32bit types than it is on 8bit ones. If you prefer, the processor
      would convert these types to 32bit anyway.
   </p>
   <p>
      Only way if you want to define these at the language level is to either let the compiler
      analyze and cast up and down itself, or let the JIT consider that as a special case.
      My guess is that hiding the slowness of byte operations by slowing down with implicit
      casting prevent the developer from knowing that what he&rsquo;s doing has performance
      implications. A warning at the compiler level could resolve this in a clean way. What
      do you think? Should we always be honest to the developer?
