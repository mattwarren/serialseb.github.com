   Thanks to the register, mary joe, scoble and others, this blog got it's biggest connection
   rate since its inception a year and half ago... 4200 connections at midnight, and
   the number of rss subscribers tripled.

   About boa, i will write something tomorrow, didn't have the time today.<p>

   Now that i have a bigger audience, what do you want me to blog about in the next few
   weeks? NAnt, remoting, events and delegates, SOA, blogs? What are you interested in,
   why did you come here? It's time to make use of that comments section down there!
