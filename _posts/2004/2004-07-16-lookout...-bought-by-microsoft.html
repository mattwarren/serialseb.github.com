   <p>
      Just read that <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+buys+Lookout+to+boost+search/2100-1032_3-5271825.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5271825&amp;subj=news.1032.5">Microsoft
      was buying Lookout</a>. I&rsquo;ve been a huge user and supporter of that software
      since Robert mentioned it, and pleased to see Microsoft is actually interested in
      pushing this kind of technology forward.&#160;
