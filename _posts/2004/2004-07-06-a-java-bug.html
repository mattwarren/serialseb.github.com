title: A Java bug
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      While debugging a former colleague code, a Java servlet&#160;running under TomCat,
      we found the following interesting bug (interesting because google is not reporting
      a lot of results!). 
   </p>
   <p>
      Whenever you create a URL object pointing to a normal file url (<a href="file:///c:/document.xml">file://c:/document.xml</a>)
      and try to call the openStream method, you get this <b>very informative</b> exception: 
   </p>
   <div style='border:solid windowtext 1.0pt;padding:1.0pt 4.0pt 1.0pt 4.0pt'>
      <p style='background:#FFFF99'>
         <i>UnknownHostException: C</i> 
      </p>
   </div>
   <p>
      It seems that the URL object is picking the ftp transport to try and initialize the
      connection, and that&rsquo;s where the bug is. Trying <a href="file:///c:/document.xml">file:///c:/document.xml</a> doesn&rsquo;t
      work either, nor does <a href="file:///c:/document.xml">file:///c|/document.xml</a>.
      The correct solution is in fact: 
   </p>
   <p>
      file:c:/document.xml which is turned internally to file:/c:/document.xml 
   </p>
   <p>
      If anyone has an explanation on the reason of this weird behavior, I&rsquo;d love
      to hear it! 
   </p>
