title: Monitoring Web Server online status

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      If you&rsquo;ve been reading my blog regularly (and I know you&rsquo;re about 25 around
      here <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span>), you know I&rsquo;ve been playing
      (and suffering) with ISA Server 2004. <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/03/11/87853.aspx">This
      post</a> from Roy reminds me of a functionality that is really nice when having several
      boxes for all your servers. ISA Server can actually monitor, by either pinging, simulating
      an HTTP request, or doing nasty ICMP based stuff, and alert you as soon as possible
      about a potential problem. It&rsquo;s all included. Let&rsquo;s say it is definitely
      a very nice feature, the kind of touch that makes you scream in pleasure.&#160;
