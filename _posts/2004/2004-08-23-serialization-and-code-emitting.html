title: Serialization and code emitting
---

<p>
   And finally, in the "I follow Julien's tracks", a really <strong>nice</strong> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/07/NETMatters/default.aspx">MSDN
   article</a> about how the XBOX live team reads and writes data with their C++ clietn
   using both reflection and code emit. I used a very similar approach with CoAD, but
   i was using templated compile time code generators. I might adopt this technique with
   the development of CoAD v3, as the template is starting to be very messy (mainly because
   of the bad habit of C++ devs to include refs in some fields based on the value of
   another, etc).

<p>
   I <strong>will</strong> post some code about that in the future. Don't have the time
   now though!
