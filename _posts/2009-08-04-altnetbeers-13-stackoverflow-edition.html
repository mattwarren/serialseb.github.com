<p>Just to let everyone know that we’ll be organizing the AltNetBeers on the evening <strong>after</strong> the StackOverflow London conference, on the 28th of October. The event will be up when we’ve arranged a location a bit later, but you can pre-register by commenting on this entry.</p>  <p>That way, the hangover won’t kill the early morning enthusiasm, and with enough notice those of you that want to do both can organize their travel plans more easily.</p>
