I’m back online, finally. I announced here that I would bring the blog back online the 3rd of January… So a month later here I am. Sorry for those of you who read this blog for letting you down. DSL takes a lot of time to be activated at my new place. Nice 4 bedroom house by the way.

The tech side of the post now: It is all running on a brand new server, with:

·         Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition

·         Internet Server and Acceleration 2004 beta 2

·         Exchange Server 2003

·         IIS 6 with [dasBlog](https://web.archive.org/web/20040215203222/http://blog.thetechnologist.net/ct.ashx?id=d5daad1b-7138-4c74-9f87-ef8e4e6c01f9&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dasblog.net) 1.5

Very good configuration, RAM usage is about 440mb, but it also have a dns and dhcp server and a few other nifties… Any advice to reduce the memory footprint appreciated :)
