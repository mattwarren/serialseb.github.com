Last week I finally managed to catch up with Scott for a little podcast talking about Practical ReST, the course and a
few other bits and pieces.

As a rule I never listen to myself on video or audio (find it atrociously creepy), so please [go and listen][1], and let
me know what you think!

I'm still working on the site so bear with me while it all slowly comes together!
