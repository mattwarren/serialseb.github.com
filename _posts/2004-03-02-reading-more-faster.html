title: Reading more, faster

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      As I&rsquo;ve been quite ill for the last few days (don&rsquo;t know if 39 degrees
      Celsius on wake up would be considered &ldquo;quite&rdquo; ill for most people. I
      don&rsquo;t. I just pretend.) I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to read more entries
      in less time. I don&rsquo;t follow the scoble rule about moving posts in a special
      outlook folder, but I do flag them. And I finally found today the missing piece. 
   </p>
   <p>
      All blogs go in their own folder. I use a search folder to show me all the unread
      entries. I read them one after the other, and can switch using the <b>SPACE</b> key.
      And when something looks interesting enough to remember or to blog about, I quick
      flag it&hellip; This is where it is interesting. You can do so by pressing <b>INSERT</b>.
      And this is not in the menu, only hidden in the outlook 2003 help file. What&rsquo;s
      the point in putting <i>some</i> shortcuts on the menu and not others? Anyone have
      a rationale as to why they did that in outlook?&#160;
