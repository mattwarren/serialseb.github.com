   <p>
      There will be a lot of posts today, I have quite a serious backlog and don&#8217;t
      want to do one of these HUGE posts that only <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/">Chris
      Brumme</a> can successfully write.&#160; 
   </p>
   <p>
      Back to the point, the ISA Server 2004 beta, code name <i>stingray</i>, which you
      can find <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/isaserver/beta/">here</a>, has a brand
      new UI, and that changes everything. It is more configurable, publishing of servers
      works much better, etc. 
   </p>
   <p>
      However, if you try to get your ISA Server on a machine with DNS and DHCP (as I do
      on my internal network, serving my 3 computers, honey&#8217;s computer, flat mates
      computers and even the street computer, there&#8217;s a gotcha. 
   </p>
   <p>
      First, head to <a href="http://www.isaserver.org/articles/isa2004beta2.html">this
      article</a> on the <a href="http://www.isaserver.org/">ISA Server community site</a>.
      Thomas describes what needs to be done to get DNS working, and drop a hint on DHCP.
      You have to allow incoming DHCP (server) protocol using a routing rule on the &#8220;All
      Networks&#8221; network set. This is not a feature but a known bug in the beta 2.
      I hear you saying: But my poor poor Sebastien, you must still be drunk from <a href="http://www.simplegeek.com/PermaLink.aspx/fdb20fc3-57ea-4275-bacc-85a4116b8e8c">that
      night</a> to ask me to allow any DHCP request going through my network? Fear not my
      friend. First you&#8217;re not supposed to put the beta 2 in production. Second, you
      just have to only allow the DHCP RESPONSE to go through wherever you want to allocate
      them. Finally, you shouldn&#8217;t rely on DHCP addressing to secure your network. 
   </p>
   <p>
      I&#8217;m going to see tonight if you can still secure your network to prevent some
      kind of DHCP request attack by adding a second rule blocking the request on the external
      Network set.
