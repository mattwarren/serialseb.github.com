<p>Following on the success of the previous events,I am happy to announce the next alt.net London Beers event.</p>  <p>The format is going to be different from the previous event, as it will be a sort of mini openconf-style session. Here are the rules</p>  <ul>   <li>Arrivals, discussion and socializing between 18:00 and 19:00, with one necessity: <strong>find the topic of the day </strong>and <strong>find the questions that we will try to answer</strong>. We may provide post-its, white boards or body painting equipment to help people focus.</li>    <li>At 19:00 the big clock will start ticking for a time-boxed 60 minutes workshop on the subject. The goal is simple: <strong>can we as a group get insight and progress our understanding of the problem</strong>. The specifics of the format will probably change when we get there, but I’d like us to focus on up to 4 questions.</li>    <li>At 20:00 the clock will ring and that will be it of the conversation. Everyone will be invited to fill-in a wiki with a one or two line answer for each of those questions. The goal is to capture a snapshot of the state of mind at the event, and to be able to compare those with the result of our reflections that, I’m sure, will be extensively shared on blogs, mailing lists, twitter, etc.</li>    <li>One this is all written down, everybody will be able to continue the discussion in the pub or wherever they see fit.</li> </ul>  <p>Please leave comments here and everywhere you feel relevant, or hit me on twitter, to suggest topic ideas or to provide criticism of the whole concept. Without feedback one cannot separate success from failure, and recognizing those are necessary to progress and improve.</p>  <p>If your company wants to invest a bit of money behind the bar for food and drinks, don’t hesitate to let me know.</p>  <p>And of course, the location is the same as the previous event, and I have been told the kitchen staff will stay a bit longer for us this time.</p>  <p><strong>The Blue Posts      <br /></strong>18, Kingly Street     <br />London W1B 5PX</p>  <p><iframe marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=18+kingly+street&amp;sll=51.512829,-0.139389&amp;sspn=0.011978,0.02459&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.519319,-0.135355&amp;spn=0.039308,0.075531&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;output=embed&amp;s=AARTsJqLji5hBSSopZMwTl4fxr2M1WH-dg" frameborder="0" width="425" scrolling="no" height="350"></iframe>    <br /><small><a style="color: #0000ff; text-align: left" href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=18+kingly+street&amp;sll=51.512829,-0.139389&amp;sspn=0.011978,0.02459&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=51.519319,-0.135355&amp;spn=0.039308,0.075531&amp;z=14&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;source=embed">View Larger Map</a></small></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <p></p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:66e13c07-83ff-415f-a265-c1bc753b3991" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/altdotnet" rel="tag">altdotnet</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/altnetuk" rel="tag">altnetuk</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/alt.net" rel="tag">alt.net</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/altnetbeers" rel="tag">altnetbeers</a></div>
