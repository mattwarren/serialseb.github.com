   <p>
      If you didn&rsquo;t notice, my blogging rate is going up these days&hellip; But it
      seems this in turn gets me more people. My traffic has been going higher ever since
      I started this new, Scoble like snippet publishing mode. I think I&rsquo;ll continue
      that way.&#160;Or maybe it&rsquo;s just because in two weeks I had links from <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/">Mary
      Jo Foley</a>, <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/">Eric
      Gunnerson</a>, which follows several links from <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/">Roy
      Osherove</a>, <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/team/dbox/default.aspx?key=2004-03-24T07:08:11Z">Don
      Box</a>, <a href="http://www.benjaminm.net/">Benjamin Mitchell</a>, <a href="http://www.dasblonde.net/PermaLink.aspx?guid=03ba66f1-ef8b-4ca3-8ada-852000b6feb9">dasBlonde</a> (doesn&rsquo;t
      she look fantastic?), and of course <a href="http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/">IanG</a> which
      is a regular slapper of this blog :-) (I do like the attention). I must say I&rsquo;m
      quite proud!
