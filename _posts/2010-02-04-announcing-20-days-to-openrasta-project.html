<p>As some of you already know, I’m very excited that <a href="http://www.openrasta.com">OpenRasta</a> is being presented at <a href="http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/EX19">Mix10 in Vegas</a> by none other than the talented <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/kyle.baley/archive/2010/01/28/open-rasta-presentation-or-how-to-throw-a-rest-into-the-mix.aspx">Kyle Baley</a>. As I’ve not realised the 2.0 RTM bits yet, I thought it’d be great if we could release a fresh 2.0 RTM build for the occasion.</p>  <p>This is a call to action to the users, adorers and believers: OpenRasta needs you!</p>  <p>In the next 20 days, starting from this Friday, let’s try and all commit some of our time to OpenRasta in one way or another. There’s a lot to be done and focused on, from the new web site, to updates to the code base, to enhancing the documentation. </p>  <p>To participate, just <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openrasta/">join the mailing list</a>, find something interesting you’d like to be doing, and commit to work on it on a certain day.</p>  <p>On top of that, from this weekend, I’ll be organizing a code-a-thon on either day, with anyone that cares to join me for a day of pure pair programming coding on some of the OpenRasta code-base. Want to see extensible authentication done? Donate your day, we’ll have coffee and lunch and lots of code! Not in London? We’ll use Skype. No excuse!</p>  <p>As for me, I hereby promise to start posting a videocast a day for 20 days. Provided we have somewhere to host the videos and someone can help out with the encoding!</p>  <p>I’ll update this post with all the commitments that were made to help get a new release out of the door in time for Mix.</p>
