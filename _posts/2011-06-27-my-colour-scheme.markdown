People have asked before, after giving presentations, to share my theme. Yes, I commit the cardinal crime of refusing presenting on a white background, it hurts my brain too much.

So I introduce DarkSeb, a Dark blue derivative theme for VS. It’s optimized for the “color identifiers” and “highlight current line” options of ReSharper.

And you can [download it on GitHub](http://github.com/serialseb/config/blob/master/darkseb.vssettings).
