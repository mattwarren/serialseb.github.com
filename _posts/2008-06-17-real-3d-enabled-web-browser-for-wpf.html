<p>I know, some of you think that the browser control in the latest WPF 3.5 SP1 is the dog's bollocks. Sadly, it suffers from its origin as a wrapper around good old GDI and the lack of GDI redirection imposed by supporting WPF in Windows XP environments.</p>  <p>One thing I keep track of very closely is what the mono guys do. This is a fantastic pool of resources, skills and code, and if I had time to hack I'd probably join one of their many projects. And on their feed I came across Alp's post describing a <a href="http://www.atoker.com/blog/2008/06/12/webkit-meta-a-new-standard-for-in-game-web-content/">WebKit-based 3d web browser</a>. I can't wait to have a play with the code.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:86d5b5f8-6996-4033-8845-459a00ae1fe6" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/mono" rel="tag">mono</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/c#" rel="tag">c#</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/webkit" rel="tag">webkit</a></div>
