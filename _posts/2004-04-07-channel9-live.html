   <p>
      Well well well, everybody is crazy over <a href="http://www.channel9.com/">www.channel9.com</a> these
      days, either loving it or hating it. Well, I have to admit that the experiment looks
      good. And the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/04/06.html#a7171">most
      prolific blogger</a> is one of the heads behind it&hellip; 
   </p>
   <p>
      But Robert&hellip; You know what it is all about: syndication. But because we want
      it conversational, it shouldn&rsquo;t be [OneWay]. It should be duplex syndication.
      So here is what I want to see in channel9. 
   </p>
   <p>
      First, emphasize people inside Microsoft and people outside Microsoft. That&rsquo;s
      right, promote content with other people to feed a live video based discussion published
      through rss where rory, Julia and me could all talk together on the topics we want.
      Obviously, the only limit is the resources for that, but I&rsquo;m sure there must
      be a way. Like a geek aggregator that detects the cool discussion trends, and go to
      people to aggregate the best stuff on a per discussion basis. 
   </p>
   <p>
      And second, that one is easier. If channel9 aggregate outside, why can&rsquo;t I aggregate
      it myself? What I mean is, when I&rsquo;m on <a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/">Chris
      Sells blog</a>, I want to see everything he did&hellip; And if he publish content
      out of it (video, articles, discussion, etc), and it&rsquo;s regular, and it&rsquo;s
      elsewhere, he should be able to aggregate the content of channel9 on his own blog.
      Merge the web site boundaries, isn&rsquo;t it what it is all about?&#160;What I mean
      is something along the line of: <a href="http://syndication.channel9.com/getRss.ashx?subject=csells@microsoft.com">http://syndication.channel9.com/getRss.ashx?subject=csells@microsoft.com</a> uh?
      Not doable? 
   </p>
   <p>
      This is somewhere where I feel things are lacking. The only thing people think about
      is unicast distribution. I publish content, publish a feed, and you may link to it.
      Robert started a new stuff, a personal aggregated link directory of all the cool stuff.
      That is still unicast but distributed. But when you put into the equation cross-blogging,
      multiple content providers for a single person, you reach a point where we MUST leverage
      the technology to provide a true conversational aspect. With a flow, and without a
      boundary between different publishing sources. 
   </p>
   <p>
      May the force be with you.
