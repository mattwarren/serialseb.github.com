title: What's to come
---

<p>
   Just to let you know what I'm working on at the moment:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      An article on IIS undocumented, everything you wanted to know about aspnet_isapi.dll
      without daring to ask it</li>
   <li>
      An article on how to break a protocol encryption, or how reverse engeneering always
      succeed over security through obscurity</li>
   <li>
      An article on a dynamic script engine and the related challenges it poses</li>
   <li>
      An article on how to write a simple compiler for a dynamically typed language</li>
   <li>
      An article on how to write a MasterPage system that works and is not a hack, and how
      to provide url rewritting at the same time, the proper way</li>
   <li>
      An article on how to provide a Watson like infrastructure for your windows applications</li>
   <li>
      Hopefully, get to work with the dotnetguru.org team on their english web site</li>
</ul>
<p>
   I think that's enough to last for a few weeks. The first article is already about
   4200 words and i'm not happy about it yet.
</p>
<p>
   By the way, anyone willing to publish one of these articles can mail me :)
