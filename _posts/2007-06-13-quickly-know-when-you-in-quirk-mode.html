<p>While debugging an application rendering issue yesterday (yes, I'm back to a bit of asp.net work, with CSS adapters and asp.net AJAX, oh the joy!) I came up with a very quick way to know when you're in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirk_mode">quirk mode</a>.</p> <p>In the address bar, type the following:</p> <div style="font-size: 10pt; background: white; color: black; font-family: consolas, courier new"> <p style="margin: 0px">javascript: window.alert(document.compatMode);</p></div> <p>CSS1Compat means the browser is not in quirk mode.</p> <p>Simple and efficient, but of course not with frames (which you shouldn't use anyway!)</p>
