title: The google power
---

<p>
   I said earlier how I thought that google was giving way too much power to blogs for
   the taste of the corporate world.
</p>
<p>
   I had a wierd proof of that today when I checked my referrals. Turns out that on a
   search for <a href="www.cubiks.com">Cubiks</a> on <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=cubiks&btnG=Search&meta=cr%3DcountryUK%7CcountryGB">google
   UK</a>, I'm listed as the 8th items. Even more frightening, I'm listed before any
   other non cubiks web site.
</p>

   I believe this definitly is a reversal of power on the web. Imagine if I wanted to
   criticize this company for whatever reason, my entry would end up being up there before
   anything else. Before comments from real clients. And even more than that, I am not
   responsible for it.
