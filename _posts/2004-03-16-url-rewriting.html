title: Url Rewriting

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      Jesse talks about <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/jezell/archive/2004/03/15/90045.aspx">URL
      rewriting</a> and propose a, well, solution to the problem.&#160;I know where he comes
      from, but there&rsquo;s a much much easier way to handle it. I will detail it in my
      master template architecture paper (yes, I&rsquo;m getting late in article writing
      these days) but you really just need to implement an IHttpHandler and compile the
      aspx page yourself&hellip; 
   </p>
   <p>
      Obviously the process (taking one url, changing it to call another url) is different
      than doing the work yourself, but you achieve the same goal, as it&rsquo;s exactly
      what .net is there for. And the HttpContext being constructed on the <b>original</b> URL,
      no need to change anything, it will just work.
