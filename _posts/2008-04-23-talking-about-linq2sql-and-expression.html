<p>If you're in London, why not join us tonight to <a href="http://www.zimakki.com/blog/index.php/2008/04/22/london-net-event-23rd-april/">celebrate Visual Studio 2008 and .net 3.5 releases at the London .net user group</a>? We'll be discussing some of the new features in the bits, and I shall be presenting some useless code that shows integration testing and fluid database design using Linq2Sql, with some expression tree goodness.</p>
