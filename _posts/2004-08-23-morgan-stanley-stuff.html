<p>
   What is going on about Morgan Stanley in the Syndication world?
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      Strategist Andy Xie <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/fo/20040819/bs_fo/920e1c0dcb5576a697d774d85757cac9">warns
      about a "hard landing"</a> in lot of sectors in China because they attract too many
      investors on the hope of growth. Are we living a Yellow bubble? If that one was to
      burst, the whole Asian region could go down. (<strong>Yahoo News</strong>) 
   <li>
      Morgan Stanley is also <a href="http://www.commoditytrader.com/archives/000063.php">managing
      fuel for United Airlines</a> through their Commodities businesses. And it seems it's
      quite lucrative! Something I really didn't expect from an investment bank. Amazing!
      (<strong>Commodity Trader</strong>) 
   <li>
      Cisco and Wal-Mart going down, Yahoo and Ebay going up, that's the <a href="http://www.commoditytrader.com/archives/000063.php">latest
      index</a> provided by Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc. (<strong>Bloomberg</strong>) 
   <li>
      <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/perfectlyvague/611240.html">PerfectlyVague
      thinks we're a boring company</a>. Girl, you ought to come around, there are lot of
      funny people and the atmosphere is far from being that boring! Tell you what, I invite
      you for coffee in our building, you'll see how cool everything is here! And yes, i <strong>was
      really surprised</strong> at how relaxed one can be and on how much resources are
      devoted to people feeling ok about their job. Can you spell S-U-P-P-O-R-T-I-V-E? Ok
      maybe I can't but the company definitely does! 
   <li>
      From Canada, Morgan Stanley also <a href="http://www.canada.com/news/business/story.html?id=3fe7cd35-0ba9-4214-8a59-74cd1de67644">gets
      the contract</a> with <a href="http://www.sycamorenet.com">Sycamore Networks</a>.
      Our company definitely has more and more of a portfolio of IT companies... For the
      names, type them in a search engine I can't name but you know! ;-) (<strong>Canada.com</strong>) 
   <li>
      As this&nbsp;blog highly respect all opinions,<a href="http://www.memes.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3128"> this
      one </a>made me laugh for quite a while. Just a snippet: "<em>then we'll know how
      much of Bush family is controlled by the Saudis/British Crown!</em>". Frankly amusing
      if you don't take it seriously. If you do, how about <a href="http://www.nhs.gov.uk">trying
      this web site </a>instead? 
   <li>
      Still on the subject of Morgan Stanley and petroleum, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;u=/nm/20040820/bs_nm/energy_anadarko_dc">Andarko
      is selling </a>its gulf assets to Apache Corp and a royalty interest to Morgan Stanley
      Capital Group. (<strong>Yahoo</strong>) 
   <li>
      <a href="http://www.ntxe-news.com/artman/publish/article_18442.shtml">Morgan Stanley
      supports Collin County children</a>. Yes, our company is giving back to the community,
      and not only&nbsp;with money. Did you know that Morgan Stanley employees can have
      a day off, fully paid, to go and do some community work, once a year? (<strong>North
      Texas e-News</strong>) 
   <li>
      And for you advices junkies, William Hill <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/business/citywire/story.jsp?story=554174">has
      been upgraded</a>&nbsp;to overweight from equal-weight. Now if anyone took the time
      to explain all these barbarian words to me, i'd be glad to explain multi threading
      as a payback. (<strong>Independent.co.uk</strong>) 
   <li>
      And it would seem Morgan Stanley is going back to <a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/spages/467531.html">investing
      in Israel</a>. (<strong>Haaretz.com</strong>) 
   <li>
      Finally, Morgan Stanley thinks that the interest rate in the UK <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?xml=/money/2004/08/22/cnrates22.xml&amp;menuId=242&amp;sSheet=/money/2004/08/23/ixcity.html">has
      reached a peek</a>. Quoting the article: "Baker suggests one more rate rise is possible,
      although this would be unlikely". The article also says that the City as a whole always
      fails at predicting peaks and troughs since 97. We'll see about that one, be back
      in November and I'll track back on my own entry. (<strong>Business Telegraph</strong>)</li>

   I actually start liking monitoring all that financial information. There's much more
   happening than what I publish, but if it's not available in feeds it doesn't get to
   me. And I bet you most investors will do the same way in a few years.<br>
