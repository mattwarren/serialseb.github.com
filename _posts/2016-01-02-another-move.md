As we say goodbye to 2015, a year my blog has had **no updates** at all, for reasons I may share with you one day, I'm thrilled with this new development.

It has taken months, hundred of hours labouring on various keyboards, crawling through archive.org and old hard drives, designing, failing, designing again, copying, typing, hacking. But here we are.

This is my new home, with a new dashing logo. You will find all the content from the old codebetter.com blog, the blogger.com blog, and even the old thetechnolgist blog. If you want to read the crazy things I used to say when I was younger and full of that fire that burns in your loins in your twenties, the archives now go back all the way to 2003.

Welcome back.
