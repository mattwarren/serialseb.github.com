<p>A great conference is nearly upon us, QCon London has opened its doors today for the first of two days of workshops. As it happens, I am <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/presentation/Building+a+ReSTful+architecture+on+.net+with+OpenRasta">presenting on OpenRasta</a> on Thursday and on <a href="http://qconlondon.com/london-2011/presentation/Building+composite+applications+in+a+package-managed+world">OpenWrap and composite applications</a> on Friday.</p>  <p>For those of you that don’t know OpenSpaceBeers, we’re also organizing an open-space Jerry Springer style on Thursday night. It’s always very invigorating, very lively, you contribute <strong>if you want to</strong>: one hour time-boxed open space to discuss whatever you feel like on that night. <a href="https://secure.trifork.com/london-2011/freeevent/register.jsp?eventOID=3029">Come and join by registering right now</a>, it’s opened to everyone (QCon or no QCon).</p>  <p>We may see the release of a few prototypes being demoed at QCon very soon, so if you have the opportunity, come talk about OpenRasta 3.0 and OpenWrap 1.1 with me, it sure is going to be a fun ride.</p>
