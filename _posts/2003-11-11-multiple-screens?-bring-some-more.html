   My office. As you can see, my <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;dualCurrId=73&amp;categoryId=2072541">IBM
   T30 </a>has a dual screen Radeon video card. I was&nbsp;a bit surprised that Black
   n White is actually running quite well on it.

   The second screen is a SyncMaster 171s, a 17" flat that we were given. Quite nice,
   although I must say I'm getting used to the high resolution of the laptop.

   The third screen, well, I'm a bit cheating there. It's not a third screen, but my
   windows 2003 test box (the one having the test server and the auto build system).
   I use a MK named <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">Synergy </a>to move only
   my main keyboard and mouse around. This tool won my "geek trophy" weekly contest.

   Frankly, a 3 21" LCD configuration would be ideal for me (that is, 3 1600 * 1200 screens),
   in high resolution it would be even better. I still have to find any video card supporting
   more than 2 DVI outputs though. Anyone?

   (Will post my configuration at home later today).
