title: Google have a new googlebot?

I was looking at my user agents on this blog, and what was my surprise when i saw this:

Googlebot/Test (+http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html)

There's a new Test blot on the go? It's hitting me much less than the main 2.1 one. Wierd.<img width="0" height="0" src="http://blog.thetechnologist.net/aggbug.ashx?id=83c81b7e-d797-49a1-af1f-e984a056b1dc">
