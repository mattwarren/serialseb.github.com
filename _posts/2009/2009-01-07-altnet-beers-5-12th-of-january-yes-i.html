<p>With all the festive excitements, I really thought I had announced this when I put the date down on <a href="http://ukdotnet.ning.com">http://ukdotnet.ning.com</a> but I obviously didn’t.</p>  <p>So as (nearly) every months, we’ll be holding our monthly alt.net meeting in Soho next Monday, with tester extraordinaire and dynamic language addict <a href="http://blog.benhall.me.uk/">Ben Hall</a>. Please register on <a title="http://ukdotnet.ning.com/events/altnet-london-beers-5" href="http://ukdotnet.ning.com/events/altnet-london-beers-5">http://ukdotnet.ning.com/events/altnet-london-beers-5</a> so I know how many of you to expect. We also usually wait for everyone to have arrived before starting, and if you’re not on the list we can’t start!</p>  <p>The format is a mini openconf-style session. Here are the rules, slightly changed to learn from the previous event.</p>  <ul>   <li>Arrivals, discussion and socializing between 18:00 and 19:15, with one necessity: <strong>find the topic of the day </strong>and <strong>find the questions that we will try to answer</strong>. </li>    <li>Between 19:15 and 19:30 we will vote on the subject we want to talk about, in two rounds, by raising hands.</li>    <li>At 19:30 the big clock will start ticking for a time-boxed 60 minutes workshop on the subject. The goal is simple: <strong>can we as a group get insight and progress our understanding of the problem</strong></li>    <li>If the subject stales, the subject can switch to a new one, the second down in the list of votes.</li>    <li>At 20:30 the clock will ring and that will be it of the conversation. We’ll do a roundtable of each person where I’ll be asking you to <strong>decide of an action you’re going to take</strong> based on the discussion (something new we didn’t do until now).</li>    <li>Then everyone will write it down for wiki publication, everybody will be able to continue the discussion in the pub or wherever they see fit. </li> </ul>  <p>The location</p>  <p>We should be able to hold our reunion at the Tequilla lounge bar, <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/10/altnet-london-beers-4-25th-of-november.html">like last time</a>. I’ll have confirmation tomorrow, and if not I’ll announce here a new location.</p>
