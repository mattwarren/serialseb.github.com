<p>Just a quick reminder. My some mistake of history, I’ve been asked to deliver workshops alongside Ayende, Scott Bellware, Hammet, Mike Hadlow, Ian Cooper, David Laribee and Robert Pickering. I have to admit I’m very anxious to be surrounded by such people! Anyway, it’s going to be an absolute blast and extreme experience for anyone taking part.</p>  <p>I’ve just been reminded that if you register before the 4th of March, the 3 days of training will cost you £525, and before the end of may £700.</p>  <p>So if you care about all things progressive and the great speakers that will be presenting (and me), make your way to <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-exchange">SkillsMatter and book now</a>!</p>
