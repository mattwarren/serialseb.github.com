<p>Iâ€™m very pleased to announced that this weekend, for a day only, Greg Young will be delivering a workshop for the AltNetGroup, for free, in London, on Command-Query Separation.</p>  <p>3 tickets will be available daily at 2PM on the <a href="http://altnetgroup.com/workshops/greg-cqs.aspx">AltNetGroup</a> site.</p>
