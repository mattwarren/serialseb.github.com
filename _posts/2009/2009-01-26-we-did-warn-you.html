<p> Received in my inbox today from an ex-colleague. This made me smile.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Subject: ARGH THE FUCKIN ENTITY FRAMEWORK!     <br />Received: 29 January 2009</p>    <p>What a load of s******t     <br />Sorry had to get that off my chest...</p>    <p>&#160;</p>    <p>Received: 26 January 2009 11:27</p>    <p>Lead Dev - &quot;Oh it's really good you just drag and drop your tables on and it creates all your classes for you&quot;     <br />N - &quot;F********* OFF&quot;</p>    <p>&#160;</p>    <p>Received: 26 January 2009 13:08</p>    <p>Just spent the last 2.5 hours hand editing some XML.&#160; Probably due to a bug in the &quot;designer&quot; but who knows.     <br />Bring back NHibernate :-(</p> </blockquote>  <p>No comment.</p>
