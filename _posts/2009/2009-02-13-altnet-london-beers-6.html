<p>We’re going back to the original schedule of last Tuesday of the month. Here’s the <a href="http://ukdotnet.ning.com/events/altnet-london-beers-6">excerpt from the ning site</a> (on which you should go and register right now to let us know how many of you will be coming).</p>  <blockquote>   <p>This month, TeQUILA\UK host us and ThoughtWorks will feed us! That means free pizza, thanks guys!</p>    <p>An hour-long timeboxed openconf-style session where the one subject being discussed will be chosen by the attendants. And of course all this in a pub environment, fueled with just enough beer to make everybody participate.</p>    <p>The event is from 6pm and we start at 7:30pm sharp (ish).</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hope to see you there.</p>
