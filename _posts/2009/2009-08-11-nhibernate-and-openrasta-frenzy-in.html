<p>On a very positive note, I’ll be delivering Skillsmatter’s <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/course/open-source-dot-net/core-persistence-with-nhibernate">NHibernate course</a> in Aarhus, Denmark, from the 26th to the 28th of August. </p>  <p>I’m also discussing with some guys to get an <a href="http://www.openrasta.com">OpenRasta</a> presentation there so you can hear what the fuss is all about.</p>  <p>And I’ll take the Saturday to visit Copenhagen, as it would be a shame not to. If some people are available Saturday we can meet for a beer and a chat.</p>  <p>First time in Denmark, I’m quite excited!</p>
