title: BitVector replacement
---

<div class=Section1>
   <p>
      A long long time ago, there was a <a href="http://www.aspzone.com/posts/179.aspx">discussion </a>&nbsp;(and <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/weblog/sudhakar/posts/559.aspx">here</a>)
      about the BitVector32 class being buggy. My main problem was that it was not feature
      complete, and I still had to rely on a lot of bit shifting, which is, for people like
      me, very error prone. Associated with a good code generator, this class is a perfect
      tool to build UNION like structures in .net without relying on the marshaling classes. 
   </p>

      Roy mentions that I should mention the bug in the original implementation:
   </p>
   <p>
      <em>"<font size=2>the indexer always returns false for bit #31"</font></em>
   </p>
   <p>
      <font size=2>While this problem in itself would have been enough to rewrite the original
      code, you'll see that my API is really different. My main problem was to be able to
      deal with different types (a 3bits value, 3 bools as bits, and all the awful things
      C++ developers just writing their structs on a network pipe make us, poor .net people
      without&nbsp;a UNION thing, incapable of handling).

      I developed this piece of code, so here it is for your pleasure. Notice that this
      piece of code is provided for your use for free as long as you pay me a beer (or a
      RedBull). Oh, and acknowledgments never hurts!

      Enjoy.

      Edit: Sorry about the previous entry, forgot that IIS doesn't want to serve .cs files
      whatever happens :)
