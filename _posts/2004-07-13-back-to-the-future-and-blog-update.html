   <p>
      I just finished backing up my old old blog from somewhere on the web I won&rsquo;t
      mention, and will republish these posts, for historical reasons rather than for their
      quality, over the next few days. Also, expect a new look and feel for the html side
      of things (isn&rsquo;t gray way too sad?).
