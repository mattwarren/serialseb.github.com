<ul>   <li>Self-improvement</li>    <li>Corporate adoption of lean</li>    <li>Talking about how learning how to be a good developer and a good chefs are one and the same thing</li>    <li>Talking about the American economy</li>    <li>Talking about the meaning of <em>feature</em></li>    <li>Talking about the interaction between France and Quebec from the 1960s</li>    <li>Talking about the cost of adopting technology and its value depending on the project / team size</li>    <li>Talking about the waste of adopting lean in the silo of IT</li>    <li>Talking about recognizing failure and success</li> </ul>  <p>I probably forget many, but my brain is obscured by the level of discussion and contribution that happens here. None of the PDC / TechEd events compare to the thrill you get when surrounded by extremely opinionated and excited people. I’m in geek heaven.</p>
