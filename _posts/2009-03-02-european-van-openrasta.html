<p>Last week, I got given the opportunity to present OpenRasta in the European Virtual Alt.Net meeting. It was a blast, thanks to <a href="http://colinjack.blogspot.com/">Colin</a> and <a href="http://vanryswyckjan.blogspot.com/2009/02/recording-of-sebastien-lambla-e-van-25.html">Jan</a> for organizing it!</p>  <p>And you can now have a look at the <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/3385419">screencast on vimeo</a>. OpenRastaâ€™s code-freeze is happening this week, which means a week or two more to document, update the site and publish the first binaries. And this will include a retake of this screencast that *actually* works at each step :)</p>
