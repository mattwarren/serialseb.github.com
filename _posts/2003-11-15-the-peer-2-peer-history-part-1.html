title: The peer 2 peer history, part 1
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      Hello dear readers, as promised, the first part of my peer 2 peer history. I&#8217;ll
      try to remember what happened since I started being involved in this movement, and
      will go up to seeing what Microsoft is planning with Longhorn. 
   </p>
   <p>
      What exactly is peer2peer? To put it simply, a peer 2 peer technology enables communication
      between computers with nearly no intervention form a server. Another explanation would
      be that, in a perfect p2p world, there would be no client, and only servers. Basically,
      what the web was before dial-up ISP appeared. The internet was a p2p architecture
      at its heart. So, why the focus in 2000 on this &#8220;new&#8221; peer to peer architecture?
      Because&#8230; 
   </p>
   <p>
      A long time ago, Napster was released. I won&#8217;t go through why and how it appeared
      or why and how it got crushed. Napster was a so-called p2p application, that let people
      connect to a server to know what files other people are sharing, and download these
      files directly from these other people. Technically, napster had nothing interesting
      to talk about, so I won&#8217;t go through it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      A short while after the Napster, a new software, gnutella, was released by Nullsoft.
      The story of gnutella is quite interesting. To put it short, it was published, lasted
      for a few days on AOL servers before <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/ptech/03/15/gnutella/">disappearing</a>.&#160;The
      technology being gnutella is quite interesting. Instead of relying on a central server
      to advertise files the user is sharing, the connection to a gnutella network is quite
      different: 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>The
      first step is to connect to the network. Because there is no server, the client must
      find a new IP address to connect to. This is the <b>bootstrap</b> stage. In the first
      few days of gnutella, this meant going on IRC, asking for an IP, and try connecting.
      Later on, each software vendor established their own public IP to let people connect
      faster. 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>Once
      you&#8217;re connected, you send a search. Your search is just a string, and is sent
      to the computer you&#8217;re connected to. This computer sends you back the list of
      files containing the string, and forward your request to all the computers it&#8217;s
      connected to, which in turn reply and forward. This method is called a <b>broadcast</b>,
      and was the most common operation on the network, and the one taking up most of the
      bandwidth users had. Your search was forwarded to a maximum of 7 hops, which meant
      quite a lot of computers. The network data contained two counts, TTL for time to live,
      and HOPS for the number of computers already seen. 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>When
      you wanted to download a file, you connected <b>out of band</b> using HTTP to the
      other computer having the file. 
   </p>
   <p>
      The software used to connect to the gnutella network was named a <b>servent</b>, a
      contraction of server and client. The big deal here is that everything was running
      without a central server, without a central authority, and without any form of potential
      failure point. The network was bootstrapped, autonomous and living a life on its own. 
   </p>
   <p>
      When I joined the gnutella community, in late march 2000, I met a lot of people, mainly
      on IRC. These people were both very smart, dedicated, and willing to move things forward.
      Let&#8217;s face it, the first releases of the gnutella software from nullsoft was
      crap. Ugly, not working, had bugs, etc. And there was no reason to call it gnu as
      the source code was absolutely not open source. 
   </p>
   <p>
      The people I met started deciphering the gnutella network protocol, which was a fast
      and easy process considering the very low complexity of the data structures. I even
      wrote a client in VB at the time, just for fun. 
   </p>
   <p>
      After just a few weeks of dicussing mainly with Gene Khan, which took upon himself
      to be the contact point for anything gnutella related in the world, and with people
      such as Ben Houston, a few things were very apparent: 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>Information
      on the current gnutella protocol was sparse, developers were missing a place to discuss
      about the current technology to implement their own software. 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>People
      needed a place to ask questions such as &#8220;What is the IP address&#8221;, or &#8220;Where
      can I download a client&#8221;. Newbie&#8217;s questions. 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'>
      <span style='font-family: Symbol'>&middot;<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; </span></span>The
      gnutella protocol sucked and badly needed to be replaced / extended. 
   </p>
   <p>
      So in April, we split the gnutella IRC forum and web site in three. One, gnutella,
      would be the PR group, and handling all the public (understand not developers) questions.
      The second, gnutella-dev, would help the developers&#8217; community to implement
      the gnutella protocol and behavior recommendations, to help create more software using
      gnutella. The third one, gnutella-ng, was the place where we were supposed to create
      a new gnutella protocol, erasing what mistakes we did in the past, while reusing the
      concepts of gnutella, to create a better world. I was the main architect of all these
      changes, and only took gnutella-ng in hands. Gene was keeping gnutella, and gnutella-dev
      was to be very open to anyone. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t remember who was in
      charge of it. 
   </p>
   <p>
      All these web sites were handled on wego.com. <a href="http://gnutellang.wego.com/">http://gnutellang.wego.com</a> won&#8217;t
      get you very far, but once upon a time, it was a very busy web site.
