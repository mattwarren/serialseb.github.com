title: Amsterdam here I come
---

We just arrived in amsterdam. The trip starts well, with a free upgrade in the hotel to a lovely one bedroom flat with view on amstel straat and the water...

Second good news, thanks to wifi i can leach a bit of connection from our living room, very very sweet. I don't really know if I should let the owner know that his router is still configured using the default password (thanks god for me for that matter, as the router needed to be restarted to get a connection !)

Anyone interested in meeting? I'm there till wednesday. Just IM me (gpulp@hotmail.com) or send me a mail!<img width="0" height="0" src="http://blog.thetechnologist.net/aggbug.ashx?id=2b535a50-994f-4733-84fb-f200fdd2a045">
