<p>Dear fans and readers,</p>  <p>Iâ€™ve now started writing a talk entitled <em>Top tips to ruin your agile process</em>. It is my intent to run the audience through the worst things that could happen to a team when they implement agile.</p>  <p>I have a fair share of miserable failures at turning (or keeping) a team agile, but I am now asking you to help me. Everyone has failed once or&#160; more in being agile, and I hereby plead for you to give me your horror story.</p>  <p>Feel free to do so below, the comments can be made anonymously :)</p>  <p>Thanks!</p>
