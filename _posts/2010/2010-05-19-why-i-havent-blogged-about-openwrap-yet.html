<p>Because it’s not ready and I haven’t announced it yet.</p>  <p>I showed the state of the code-base at the progressive.net workshop, to gather feedback from smart people. There was good feedback, and the latest architectural change happened the night before, so I’m still coding.</p>  <p>I’m doing it in the open, you can have a look at the code but I won’t link to it.</p>  <p>But please, please, to some of you, get off my back! If you think your package manager is better, good, I’m glad you found a tool you like.&#160; If you think the project is a bad idea because yours is better, please commit some code and show us the money.</p>  <p>Until I’ve officially announced the project, I’d be quite happy not dealing with all the negativity that has come my way since Rob’s post.</p>  <p>Kthxbye.</p>
