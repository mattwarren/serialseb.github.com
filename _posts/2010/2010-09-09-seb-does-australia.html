I've been wanting to do it for a long while, and now seems like the right time to be planning.

If you are in Australia, New Zealand, Tokyo, Singapore and can host me for an evening or a couple of days of training on ReST, nhibernate, distributed architectures, package management, software practices or just want me to hang around, please send me an email at seb@serialseb.com

The more of you show an interest, the longer I'll stay.

Let me know.
