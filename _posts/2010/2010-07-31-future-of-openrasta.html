<p>You may have noticed that development on OpenRasta has slowed down quite a bit recently. It’s a double-edge sword: the codebase is stable enough for most people, which has helped adoption of the 2.0 branch quite a bit, but at the same time there are new features that I want to see implemented.</p>  <p>As you probably know, I’m putting most of my energy on <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2010/07/intro-to-what-openwrap-is.html">OpenWrap</a> until we have a fully functioning first beta release, because I want the next version of OpenRasta to be completely built on top of it. So what is the future of OpenRasta?</p>  <h4>OpenRasta 2.0 RTM coming to a shop near you soon</h4>  <p>The current branch on github is going to be enhanced slightly by the addition of a few fixes / features that will close the loop for a 2.0 release:</p>  <ul>   <li>Http header processing will special-case our friend Set-Cookie, which will solve a bunch of issues people have been reported when trying to use those evil babies.</li>    <li>The diagnostics output is going to be made a bit nicer by actually showing the log on the web page itself rather than the dreaded “There was an error in a contributor”.</li>    <li>I’ll pull in the fixes requested by those that want to use the binder to do constructor value injection.</li>    <li>We’ll put the nice logo we’ve had and not used for so long.</li> </ul>  <p>That’s it. This should happen in the next week or so.</p>  <h4>OpenRasta 3.0</h4>  <p>I’ve decided to rename 2.1 in 3.0, for the simple reason that I’m going to move stuff around quite a bit, all driven by my need for better componentisation of the codebase, most of it driven by OpenWrap. I’m not ready to discuss the feature-set yet, but August will be the big development push on the first iteration. Expect a lot of splitting of code, of re-evaluation of some features that are not as much in use as I’d like, and hopefully a lot of bug fixes in the process.</p>  <h4>In the meantime…</h4>  <p>In the meantime, you may as well get yourself acquainted with OpenWrap, because it will be mandatory for OpenRasta 3.0.</p>  <p>I’d also like to thank Hadi and the codebetter guys, as our bug tracking has now moved to youtrack on codebetter.com, at <a title="http://youtrack.codebetter.com/issues/OR" href="http://youtrack.codebetter.com/issues/OR">http://youtrack.codebetter.com/issues/OR</a>. Let me know what you think of the new system.</p>
