<p>I’ve delayed slightly the tutorial on Part 2, as ready or not, I’m pushing binaries and the server online on the 26th of August. Call it a first preview. Delays are due to my really wanting some features that I didn’t think we would have for a first release, but I think it’s worth it, and is due to my frustration in having to deal with all the mechanics of building OpenWrap and it’s server itself.</p>  <p>Expect the second part of the guide sometime this week.</p>
