<p>I don’t usually use this blog for requesting help, but I’m afraid on this one I have to.</p>  <p>I don’t have access to an MSDN license anymore, as the cost is too high, I’m not an MVP and the ActionPack works for my professional needs. Except it doesn’t work so well with OpenRasta.</p>  <p>With the upcoming Visual Studio release, and the new OSs out there, I’m out of licenses to continue testing OpenRasta on all those platforms.</p>  <p>So, my friends, the communnity, I’m turning to you. Do you have a spare MSDN license somewhere? Do you know someone at a vendor happy to provide such a license? Maybe even Microsoft? Now is the time to help OpenRasta!</p>  <p>Email <a href="mailto:openrasta-inneed@serialseb.com">openrasta-inneed@serialseb.com</a> with your suggestions! Thanks!</p>
