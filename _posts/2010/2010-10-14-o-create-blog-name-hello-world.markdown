I have had a blog for a long time, and I’ll continue maintaining it for all the social events I organize in London. But When I was offered the chance to join the codebetter.com crew, there was no way I could say no.



I’m Sebastien Lambla, and I write two OSS frameworks you’ll hear about a lot: OpenRasta, one of the most popular ReSt and Web frameworks on .net, and OpenWrap, a package manager for .net. Expect big announcements very soon!
