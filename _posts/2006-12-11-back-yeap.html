Oh it's been such a long time. I don't have the specific date of my last post on my former thetechnologist web site, but it was quite a while ago.

I lost interest. Sad reality of the technological landscape, one can get too much work and comes a time you just need to simplify. So I did.

I also lost my domain name because paypal returned all my payments asking me to validate who i was through 250 different documents to return. I'm sure they'd have wanted a DNA sample at one point or another. Result, an hour later the domain name was registered to one of these advertisement companies. Side effect, the archives are no longer on google either.

So SerialSeb it is now, still .net but much more WPF!

Oh and I have the same issue with SerialSeb.com i've still not managed to get back either, so blogger will be hosting me for the moment.

Welcome back :)
