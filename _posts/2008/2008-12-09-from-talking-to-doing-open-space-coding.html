<p>We are having very interesting debates and conversations at every single alt.net event that has been organized. Talking with others is a great way to reach a common understanding and evolve as a community.</p>  <p>There has however not been that much coding involved, something that many people have found was missing. That’s why I’m very glad Alan Dean has announced the first iteration of a project he mentioned at our last alt.net Beers: <a href="http://alandean.blogspot.com/2008/11/space-coding-day.html">the Open Space Coding Day</a>. Go and give feedback now!</p>
