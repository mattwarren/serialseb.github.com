<p>ErricGu just posted about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2008/03/20/project-managers-for-agile-teams.aspx">the role of a project manager in an agile environment</a>.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>the person who takes that role needs to be mindful of that and willing to push any decisions that rise up back down to the time. If the person has previous experience (and a preference) for &#8220;being in charge&#8221;, they are unlikely to do a good job in that role.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Maybe I'll point <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/11/managing-managers.html">Ralph</a> (my imaginary manager from hell) to this post next time I encounter one.</p>
