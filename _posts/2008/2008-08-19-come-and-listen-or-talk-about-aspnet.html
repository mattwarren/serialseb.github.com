<p>VBug apparently didn’t learn their lessons from the last presentations and asked me to come back to deliver my Bingo asp.net MVC talk in Brighton, the day before ReMix! You can <a href="http://www.vbug.co.uk/Events/September-2008/VBUG-Brighton-Test-1st-ASPNET-develop-Use-ASPNET-MVC-to-build-Ajax-website.aspx">have a look at the event</a>, and frighteningly it is already fully booked!</p>  <p>   <p></p>    <p></p>    <p>You can expect a run-down of the MVC pattern, plenty of code (but less than last time), and of course Bingo.net in its third version. I may have some surprises in stock so be prepared for anything.</p>    <p>For anyone down in Brighton on that day, I’ll be staying there so expect a full attendance at the pub. The only true way to start any conference is with a hangover.</p></p>
