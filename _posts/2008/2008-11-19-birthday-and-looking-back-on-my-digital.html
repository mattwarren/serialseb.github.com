<p>So it’s my birthday today. Every year until this now, my birthday has be the time for doing absolutely nothing. As I geared-up my community involvement this year, I find myself with so much to do and so little time that my birthday will be an after-thought this evening. Editing of alt.net content (7 hours of raw HD material to cut, compress, publish, of which I have only started), preparation of a talk next week, publication of a detailed guide for OpenRasta’s official launch (including delivering on my plan to port the Suteki project), a backburner project for Paris… And so far no contract in London, with agents driving the prices down and a global recession that is starting to ripple its effects through non-financial companies.</p>  <p>So I thought I’d celebrate the year by looking through my blog entries and twitters to provide for myself a roadmap of what I’ve done right and wrong.</p>  <h5>2007</h5>  <p>Had issues with a <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/11/moving-on-to-greener-pastures.html">company</a> and a <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/11/managing-managers.html">manager</a> with which I didn’t manage to work. Lesson learnt from it, there is a right time to move on and a right place to be efficient. Started a long rant on <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/12/why-mock-frameworks-suck-and-how-to.html">mocks and their uses</a>, trying (poorly) to debunk the ideas that mocks were always better than fakes, and that there was a life outside of mocking frameworks. However, with the latest mocking framework syntaxes and new defaults, the problem will slowly go away.</p>  <h5>2008</h5>  <p>Spent a lot of time <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/01/comparing-serializations-or-why-flash.html">comparing and pondering how to provide data</a> for the very poor http client called flash. Attended the <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/02/altnet-conference-day-1.html">first UK alt.net conference</a> and felt so much more energized than I have been in years. Started <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/02/mvp-presentation-code.html">giving presentations in user groups</a>. Started working on the <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/04/using-rasta-1-introduction.html">first version of Rasta</a> that would lead me to write OpenRasta. Predicted that <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-next-with-cloud-storage.html">skydrive and foldershare (now WL Sync) would interop</a> through the Sync framework (but Live Mesh doesn’t use skydrive yet, so this is not realized just yet). Organized the <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/04/announcing-altnet-london-beers-event.html">first alt.net beers event</a>. <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/05/tale-of-64-megapixel-desktop.html">Changed my relationship to code</a> by switching my desktop to 30”. <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/06/hello-twitter.html">Started using twitter</a> (and it’s all <a href="http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/">@CAMURPHY</a>’s fault).Went to <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/06/nxtgenug-prefest08-dinner-fest08.html">NxtgenUG Fest08</a>. Made a point of supporting Linq2Sql and <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/06/entity-framework-don-get-fooled-in-what.html">ignore Linq2Entities</a>. <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/09/content-of-presentation-at-vbug.html">Gave</a> <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/07/aspnet-mvc-presentation.html">more</a> <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/08/come-and-listen-or-talk-about-aspnet.html">talks</a>. Went to Mix:UK, PDC, VBUG, TechEd…</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And I’m&#160; not including all the stuff I didn’t blog about. Very busy year indeed. And yet I feel I’ve pretty much under-achieved. So I take the public vow here to try harder. 5 year plan etc etc.</p>
