<p>What an absolutely crazy week! I've been working flat-out all week and still have a mountain of TODO: all over my screen.</p>  <p>Thanks to everyone that came to the asp.net MVC presentation. It's a presentation I really enjoy and look forward to give it again to other user groups. I have the feeling that I'll finally be happy with the content the third time I deliver it. And suffice it to say that I'm working very hard to actually make the bingo.net game playable.</p>  <p>Apologies are in order as I'm late delivering the code (will get around to do it, probably around Tuesday) and the slides (slide.txt) and answering some of your emails. Please bare with me while I work through the backlog.</p>
