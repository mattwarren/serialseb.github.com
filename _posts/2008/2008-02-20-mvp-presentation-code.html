<p>Last night, I've made some progress towards my long-overdue MVP series of articles, by rewriting what I had to adopt the same format as the presentation I did yesterday at the London .net user group.</p>  <p>As promised, here's the code from last night. Stay tuned for the articles.</p>  <p>Thanks to the surprisingly large audience, and thanks to those that came to me to say they were reading this blog. I still get quite shocked when people tell me they saw a specific article I've written.</p>  <p>To be fair I still get shocked when people remember my name the second time they see me, as I'm sadly quite the opposite and have a lot of trouble remembering people by name.</p>  <p>Anyway, enjoy the code in its roughest form, nearly no comments in there, and still no powerpoint slides :)</p>  <p><a href="http://www.box.net/shared/iujmno5gks"><img height="24" alt="File icon" src="http://www.box.net/thumbs/24x24/default_file.gif" width="24" align="absMiddle" border="0" />CaffeineIT.ShoppingList.zip</a></p>
