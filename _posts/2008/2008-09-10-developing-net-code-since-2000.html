<p>Over the years, I’ve had a couple of people in interviews being surprised at my assertion that I started development on .net in 2000. As I go through yet another cleanup of my email archives (I’m an archival freak) that are reaching around 15GB of data, I found this email.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>From: DeveloperStoreAdministrator@developerstore.com [mailto:DeveloperStoreAdministrator@developerstore.com]      <br />Sent: 14 November 2000 03:09      <br />To: …      <br />Subject: Thank you for your recent Microsoft purchase</p>    <p>Thank you for visiting our store, Sebastien P.
