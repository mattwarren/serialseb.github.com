<p>I was going to have yet another rant on separating everything in a ridiculous amount of project files, to <em>ensure separation</em>, and started venting to one of my colleague, at which point he mentioned Jeremy just posted on the issue: <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2008/09/30/separate-assemblies-loose-coupling.aspx">Separate Assemblies != Loose Coupling</a>. Amen.</p>  <p>Thanks Jeremy, that saves me a post.</p>
