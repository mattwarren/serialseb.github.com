<p>You know you're starting to be read too much when people get passionate about name-calling you. I'm very proud it is now happening to me, as Anonymous has proved in the <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2008/02/raising-event-without-checking-for-null.html?showComment=1207760760000#c999089605442478069">first aggressive comment</a> I've had on this blog.</p>  <p>That said, Anonymous said the sub-title of this blog should be renamed to <em>Ramblings of a self-congratulatory, self-proclaimed, egotistical doofus</em>.</p>  <p>So this is now my new tag line. Whatever you think of me, you're reading, so that's a communication channel open. If you disagree with me I'll probably learn something from you. If you agree I'm pleased I am not on my own in my rambling.</p>  <p>We're all on a journey. I'm pleased mine involves anonymous and prominent people questioning my opinions. It makes me a better geek, and that is what this blog is all about.</p>
