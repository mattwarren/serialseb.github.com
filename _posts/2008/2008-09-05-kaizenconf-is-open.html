<p>For those that were waiting for the kaizenconf registration to be open, it now is. But it’s not really a registration, it’s a request for a registration. So if I understand that correctly, I still don’t know if I’ll be there or not.</p>  <p>If you come from good old Great Britain, I’d recommend booking anyway. With the sterling going down, cancellation fees will probably be cheaper than waiting and see your money be half what it was.</p>
