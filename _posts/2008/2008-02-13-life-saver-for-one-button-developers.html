<p><a title="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/archive/2008/02/12/another-handy-shortcut-combination-shift-f10.aspx" href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/archive/2008/02/12/another-handy-shortcut-combination-shift-f10.aspx">http://codebetter.com/blogs/jean-paul_boodhoo/archive/2008/02/12/another-handy-shortcut-combination-shift-f10.aspx</a></p>  <p>I got used to use the menu system with the keyboard to compensate for the trackpad on my macbook pro not having a usable right click (the double tap behavior is erratic at best and unusable). Shift-F10 is going to make my life so much easier!</p>  <p>[Update: I just realized this shortcut works for any application. I should really increase my keyboard shortcut proficiency, especially as I don't seem to have enough space for my mouse anymore in the office...]</p>
