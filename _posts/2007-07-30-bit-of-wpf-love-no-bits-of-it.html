<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2007/07/27/what-s-new-in-wpf-3-5-here-s-fifteen-cool-features.aspx">Tim Sneath posted an answer</a> to <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/07/so-there-are-new-things-for-wpf-in-35.html">the question I asked on friday</a>&nbsp;(well, posted something that answered my question, probably without him being aware of it in the first place):</p> <p>Most of the performance improvements and some of the feature improvements will also be included in a forthcoming service pack for .NET Framework 3.0 - I don't think we've talked externally about delivery mechanisms for this at this stage, however.</p> <p>Good news! So I was right, there is a service pack in the pipeline!</p>
