<p>There are now two DDD events you need to vote for.</p>  <ul>   <li>DDD Belfast has opened votes this morning <a href="http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/Users/VoteForSessions.aspx">http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast/Users/VoteForSessions.aspx</a></li>    <li>DDD Scotland is opened for voting as well <a title="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Default.aspx" href="http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Default.aspx">http://developerdayscotland.com/main/Default.aspx</a></li> </ul>  <p>I have submitted some session to the three events, so if you want to see me rant, vote for my sessions!</p>
