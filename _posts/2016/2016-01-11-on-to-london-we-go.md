I'm very excited to be on the rota officially for NDC London, where I'll be
presenting my [Versions are evil][versions-evil-ndc] talk, on Friday at 11:40.

On Saturday, I'll also be at [PubConf][pubconf], which comes highly recommended, and I'll
be presenting some new content about the mythical 17:00 split.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
