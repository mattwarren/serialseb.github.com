Infoq has [released an article covering][infoq] [my talk on “Versioning is evil”][evilver],
which is awesome. I'm preparing new content for the blog about the subject,
and a new version of the talk for later in the year, which will complete and expand on
this.

Thanks to all that attended this talk at NDC and Progressive.net!
