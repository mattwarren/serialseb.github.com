I have to admit to being a bit of a digital hoarder. I keep digital copies of everything, and I have bits of code, svn repos and backups all the way to 2001. It probably comes from the fact that I had a big crash of my raid0 data around that time and lost everything. I still have pst files and backup archives of an old exchange server with years of emails that i've not managed to recover just yet, but eventually I will!

But I disgress. The first step in getting serialseb.com in shape was to decide what content to import. Over the years, I've moved my blog forward without taking much care in moving the old posts, resulting in four different blogs over the years.
