Having just finished a couple of contracts, I have a bit of time to refocus on finishing off this site a bit. That means I'm available for work by the way :)

I've had a great weekend recelty at [DDD Scotland][dddscot], if you haven't been, just go. The atmosphere is lovely, the conversations interesting, the food good the attendees (and organisers!) very friendly.

I presented two talks, my [Versions are evil][evilver] talk on how to avoid versions in Web APIs, and a new one, [Alice in Agile Wonderland][aliceagile], a keynote-style story of all that goes wrong in the wonderland of agile, which I had much fun delivering.

Comment sections have been added to the various talks, so if you have been there and want to continue the conversation, there's a place to do that. I'll post the various ratings for each of the talk as the next update to this site, and if I get a bit more time all the questions I can find that were asked at each of those talks.

I'm also thrilled to be presenting at [NDC Oslo][ndcoslo] a revamped version of the "Versions are evil talk", at [PubConf Oslo][pubconf] with "How to always be right on the internet", and to be presenting at [Oredev][oredev] a bit later in the year with a completely new talk. I'm hoping to see you there!
