HTTP APIs, from the RPC-style all the way to ReST, are difficult to discuss over twitter. Fear not, we now have a solution.

You can join the [HTTP APIs Slack channel][slack] now. 

There isn't a code of conduct yet, but I'll be discussing with the community to set one up shortly. In the meantime, be kind, be nice, and think of others.

Feel free to share the link with your communities. Welcome.
