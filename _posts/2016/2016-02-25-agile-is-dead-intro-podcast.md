One of the reasons I have been silent a lot in 2014 and 2015 is that I had the privilege of working with an amazing team. We created a completely new way of designing software, from the architecture to the organisation inside the team.

We found something special, and we started outreaching to the wider community to share our learnings. There is a lot in there, and that will result in yet another serial on this blog.

Rather than do an intro in text, you can start by watching the talk Marcin Floryan and myself gave at Lean Agile Scotland last year, which we called _Your Agile is dead_.

Once you got that, you can listen to us discuss our approach to agile anarchy on the cucumber podcast.
