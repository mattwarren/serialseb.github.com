If anyone is wondering what to do later this month, we're having an amazing line-up for progresive.net, June 22nd to 23rd.

I'll be presenting a newer version of my [“versioning is evil – how to do without in your http apis”](https://serialseb.com/evilver/), with code samples.

If you haven't yet, [register now](https://t.co/7uUKicRSwH) and use the code SPECIAL_LDNUG_PROGNET for 40% off, but be quick, the offer expires soon!
