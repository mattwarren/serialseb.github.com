If you want to know what package management is, how it can help you and how you can use the latest OpenWrap version to solve your dependency needs, I’m giving a free workshop for the [Cambridge Developers’ user group](http://www.camdug.com/events/36907332/?eventId=36907332&action=detail).

If you’d like to see that workshop organized in your location, let me know where and we try and organize it. In the next couple of months, I’ll be in Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium and Norway, so don’t hesitate to ask :)
