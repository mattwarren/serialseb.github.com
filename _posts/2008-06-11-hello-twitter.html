<p><a href="http://twitter.com/CAMURPHY">Craig</a> has been selling me twitter over the last few months and I always kept it on the back of my mind. From this morning twitteroo is installed and I'll be able to start moaning on <a href="http://twitter.com/serialseb">my twitter feed</a> about the poor QoS as soon as I <em>get it</em>. Right now it just looks like a web-based IRC to me.</p>  <p>Side note, when is too much information too much? Mailing lists, messenger (and often during the day visitors of this blog chatting away, usually introducing themselves with <em>asdf</em> or the time-proven <em>testing</em>), maybe I'm overcommitting?</p>
