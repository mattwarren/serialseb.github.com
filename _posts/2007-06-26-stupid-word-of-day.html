<p>Heard in a corridor.</p> <blockquote> <p>This has great <em><strong>talkability</strong>.</em></p></blockquote> <p>Maybe that's why I'll always have trouble with marketing. Of course the simplest form I can think of,</p> <blockquote> <p>This will make people talk.</p></blockquote> <p>doesn't have the same punch. Why remove the people from a <strong>marketing</strong> slang expression? Probably because marketing people prefer not to think they're manipulating (or is it <em>influencing</em>) humans.</p>
