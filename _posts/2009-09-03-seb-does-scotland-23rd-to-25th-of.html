<p>Well, it’s been a while since I’ve been a up north, and with such a <a href="http://scottishdevelopers.com/">great</a> <a href="http://scotalt.net/">community</a> up there, it was only a matter of time before I got back. Frankly, I was just looking for an excuse, and the guys have given me a beautiful one!</p>  <p>So here’s the schedule.</p>  <h4>Wednesday 23rd September</h4>  <p>Dundee – <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/390722662/seb">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/390722662/seb</a></p>  <h5>When agile goes bad, how to stay calm and move forward</h5>  <p>With applying agile methodologies comes changes in many aspects of delivering software. And with any change will come a time when something fails. How to keep everyone calm? How to provide practical solutions to prevent people from reverting back to non-agile practices at the first roadblock? Through examples gathered from personal experience and the community, we’ll explore ways to prevent the boat from sinking at the first spilled glass of water. </p>  <h4>Thursday 24th September</h4>  <p>Edinburgh - <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/event/390708620/seb">http://www.eventbrite.com/event/390708620/seb</a></p>  <h5>An intro to <a href="http://www.openrasta.com">OpenRasta</a></h5>  <p>Everybody seems to rediscover the MVC model, and new frameworks seem to appear all the time. Most of those hide the richness of the web. Come discover OpenRasta, a very opinionated framework that help you write MVC-style web applications and data services, using a unified API.</p>  <h4>Friday 25th September</h4>  <p><a href="http://scotalt.net/blog/2009/09/07/altnet-beers/">AltNetBeers Scotland edition</a></p>  <p>The scot alt.net guys have asked me to facilitate a session of AltNetBeers, which I’m really excited about. Will update with the details when I know where it’ll be organized.</p>  <p>See you there!</p>
