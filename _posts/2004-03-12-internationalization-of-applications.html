title: Internationalization of applications

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      I was going over my backlog today (about 5k unread posts that I&rsquo;m going to try
      and finish reading in the next few days), and noticed an <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/09/86555.aspx">interesting
      post</a> from Raymond (well, one of many, but one I can blog about). 
   </p>

      The subject of internationalization is highly more complex than just using resource
      files and letting applications use the ToString() method with a culture. Numbers can
      be different. In some languages, &ldquo;I&rdquo; is <b>not</b> the uppercase of &ldquo;i&rdquo;.
      Digits are not between 0-9. This subject is important to understand, and CultureInfo.InvariantCulture
      is your friend.

      For that matter, one of my early .net projects was a batch parser. I was thinking,
      well, if (command.ToUpper() == &ldquo;IN&rdquo;), it failed miserably, my Turkish
      customers thought I didn&rsquo;t care about them. They were nice enough to say that
      setting the English culture for the application resolved the issue, and I had a chance
      to correct the bug.
