I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. In scoble I try to believe. But there, you’ve gone too far. You went the commercial bullshit way. This is the quote I’m talking about:

Richard and Rob can walk around the factory floor and if they notice a problem they can add a feature right there and recompile. That's pretty difficult to do with a PocketPC isn't it?

Now I can understand how TabletPC can empower the end user. I can certainly understand how it is good for developers to work with tools their end users would (Go and read Julia’s [blog](http://www.thedatafarm.com/blog/) if you don’t know what I’m talking about).  But going against any form of any intelligent development process by saying that you can modify code and recompile just in time is by no mean the way to think about strong development processes. It’s not about software quality. Teenagers do that, but remember who you’re marketing to…

Only answer to the question why oh why did scolbe fell for marketing bullshit is if he knows more than he’s blogging. And after PDC we were supposed to know as much as him right? Come on, tell us now. You’ve said too much or not enough.
