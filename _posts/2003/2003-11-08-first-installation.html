title: First installation
---

<p>
   Today was the big installation day. I didn't want to suffer the performance problems
   of running Longhorn under a virtual PC or a VMware installation, so I started by repartitionning
   my main hard drive using the fabulous Partition Magic 8 (<a href="http://www.powerquest.com">http://www.powerquest.com</a>),
   and gave Longhorn a nice 20 gigs to play around. I can as such use the full power
   of my GeForce&nbsp;4 and my Athlon. Went smoothly, Partition magic reboots the computer
   and create the second primary partition. So far so good.
</p>
<p>
   The next step is pretty easy: from my original windowsXP OS, launch the install. No
   bootable CD, no iso files to play around with. Copy the files in a folder on Windows,
   and start the setup.exe from there.

   A few comments on these early steps:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      The graphics of the installer are... Messy at best. Really wierd. 
   <li>
      There's a bug in the installation where, if you try to run it from a path with spaces
      in its name, it won't start. 
   <li>
      There's no choice on start up for the keyboard language; That's a bit annoying.</li>
</ol>
<p>
   Other than that, the install starts, and reboot 3 or 4 times. Not a long waiting,
   and when I got back from dinner (I must say I was a bit afraid from what I read in
   the blogs) the computer&nbsp;was ready.
</p>
<p>
   A few things are annoying, upon the first reboot, the gradiant filling&nbsp;of the
   setup is really messy, it doesn't look good. But on a bright side, both of my screens
   were recognized.
</p>
<p>
   Now my first complaint. It's been what, a few years since flat panels and svga cards
   are available. Microsoft, this is for you. Get us a loader with hi res graphics; Get
   us rich medias on startup; And RECOGNIZE the resolution supported by screens and video
   cards. Can't be that hard! And that's something I'm really missing from BeOS!
</p>

   I can confirm what scoble said; HTML still works, and I'm editing my blog for Longhorn
   for the first time.
