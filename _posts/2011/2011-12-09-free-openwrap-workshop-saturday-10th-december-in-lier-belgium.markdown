You get 4 hours and a lunch (complimentary from PeopleWare) to come and talk about package management and how it can change the way you build software. It’s completely free, you just need to register on [eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/event/2561950864).

As I highlighted before, if you’re anywhere in Europe where you know of a user groupb, I’ll be happy to come and share what I learnt in the last two years building composite systems and how to build them using a package manager. Just email me at seb at serialseb dot com, and let’s make it happen!
