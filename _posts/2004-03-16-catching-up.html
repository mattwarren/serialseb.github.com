   <p>
      I&rsquo;ve been silent for the last few days as I impose on myself an absolute hiatus
      as long as I don&rsquo;t finish my homework and read everything that I missed over
      nearly one month of blogging. So here we are, I went from 4600+ posts to only 2600+,
      and intend on finishing all that by the end of the week. My backlog actually have
      about 300 posts I will blog about, so you&rsquo;ll get a lot of &ldquo;the interesting
      stuff&#160;collection&rdquo; series posts I&rsquo;m going to start writing weekly.
