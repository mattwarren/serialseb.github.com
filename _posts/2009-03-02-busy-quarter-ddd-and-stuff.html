<p>It’s been an exciting weekend. Thanks to a few prople with webcams, those of us that weren’t in Seattle have been able to follow some of the discussions at the <a href="http://altnetseattle.pbwiki.com/">alt.net seattle conf</a> and <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=altnetseattle">discuss about them</a>. You can see the recordings yourself from <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/benscheirman">Ben</a> and from <a href="http://www.kyte.tv/shanselman">Scott</a>. Makes not being in Seattle nearly bearable.</p>  <p>The great other news is that you have voted for my <em>asp.net MVC best practices</em> talk at both <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast">DDD Belfast</a> on the 4th of April and <a href="http://www.developerdayscotland.com/">DDD Scotland</a> on the 2nd of May!</p>  <p>Here’s a recap of where I’ll be in the next few months:</p>  <ul>   <li>3rd April – <a href="http://www.agileireland.cs.qub.ac.uk/whenagilegoesbad">Agile Belfast</a> - When agile goes bad: how to stay calm and move forward </li>    <li>4th April – <a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/belfast">DDD – Belfast</a> – asp.net MVC best practices </li>    <li>15th April – <a href="http://vistasquad.co.uk">VistaSquad – London</a> – asp.net MVC Introduction (although this may integrate parts of the best practices talk) </li>    <li>18th April – WebDD 09 – Reading – asp.net MVC best practices </li>    <li>22nd April – <a href="http://www.gl-net.org.uk/Events/glnet_april.aspx">Gl-net</a> – Gloucester - When agile goes bad: how to stay calm and move forward </li>    <li>2nd May – <a href="http://www.developerdayscotland.com/">DDD – Glasgow</a> – asp.net MVC best practices </li>    <li>5th May – VBUG – London – Discovering OpenRasta </li>    <li>11th May – <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/progressive-dot-net-exchange">SkillsMatter’s Progressive .NET workshop</a> – London – OpenRasta, an MVC Framework       <br /><em>While MVC frameworks are gaining acceptance in the .net world, few leverage the full richness of web technologies. OpenRasta was designed from the ground-up to embrace them, while providing for a very large amount of extensibility. In this workshop, you'll learn what resources are, how to design your code around them and how to leverage REST.</em> </li>    <li>14th May – <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/soa-rest/webtech-exchange-2009">SkillsMatter’s WebTech Exchange</a> – London – <em>REST, an introduction</em>, followed by <em>REST ARCHITECTURES WITH OPENRASTA</em> </li> </ul>  <p>There you go.
