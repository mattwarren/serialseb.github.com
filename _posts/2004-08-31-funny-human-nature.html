      A few weeks ago, bored one night, I was cruising a wiki somewhere on the internet.
      One of the page was talking about a meeting where they were to discuss an issue I
      was interested in. Not providing any contact information and not showing any will
      to have any feedback, I thought, well, let&rsquo;s wiki the question, hopefully it&rsquo;ll
      be taken into account and I could even get an answer. After all, we are all going
      for the same goal right? 
   </p>
   <p>
      The meeting happened but it completely slipped my mind. I did go there again today,
      to read the summary of what was discussed and decided. My question brought no answer,
      but they did decide to act upon something: 
   </p>
   <p>
      <b><span style='; font-weight:bold'>&ldquo;Prevent people from outside our group to
      edit our Wiki&rdquo;.</span></b> 
   </p>
   <p>
      I&rsquo;m speechless.&#160;<i><span style='font-style:italic'>And a bit depressed..</span></i> 
   </p>
