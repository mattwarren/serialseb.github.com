<p>And there you go. When you can’t scale up, scale out! We’re creating a new kind of talks, one where communities will meet and cross the technological Styx.</p>  <p>The first one is on Ruby, RubyOnRails and IronRuby, the presenter is Shay Friedman, the place is MRM, the time is this friday, and the <a href="http://altnetcrosstalks.eventbrite.com/">this is the link</a>.</p>
