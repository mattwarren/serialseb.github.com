title: What is all the frenzy with Rory?

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      I don&rsquo;t get it&hellip; What is that with <a href="http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/">Rory</a> attracting
      people like that? I can&rsquo;t see anything interesting about an in-the-closet gay
      geek that draws stuff on a weblog&hellip; 
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style='font-size:5.0pt'>For the stupid ones that really believed that&hellip;
      Well, get a life. Really. I love Rory, you should know better. Or don&rsquo;t. Just
      quit reading blogs. NOW!</span>
