<p>Here's a few things that went under my radar in the blogosphere about teched:</p> <ul> <li>Gill <a href="http://www.snowball.be/TechEd+2007+Day+1+From+A+Qwerty+Keyboard.aspx">gives an overview of his first day</a>, and think Barcelona is <em>dirty at first sight</em>  <li>Joao talks about the <a href="http://weblogs.pontonetpt.com/createtek/posts/24469.aspx">Influencer Community Camps pre-conference</a>. He also talks about the CSD influencers dinner on monday, but I'm afraid I was not invited, neither was I on tuesday for the MVP (as you know, I'm not an MVP :)). But tomorrow I'll attend the MS Influencers Party, Wednesday the country party, and Thursday I'm meeting up with some people from the Windows Live team. So much to do, so little time!  <li>Sascha talks about <a href="http://www.corti.com/WebLogSascha/PermaLink.aspx/6d7f3da1-7781-43d5-8aea-9fad93c11a84">the World of Warcraft IDE</a> microsoft will release with their partner as an open source project based on Visual Studio shell that was <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/11/teched-keynote.html">demo'd during the keynote</a>. Go and check it out. And Ronan let us know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ronang/archive/2007/11/05/vs2008-news-from-barcelona.aspx">he'll be in the Ask The Experts for Team System</a>.  <li>Andrei talks about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/andreimaksimenka/archive/2007/11/05/microsoft-sync-framework-and-google-gears.aspx">the Microsoft Sync announcement</a>, personally the one area I'm the most thrilled about, so thrilled the SDK is already installed and I'm coding away :)</li></ul> <p>Overall, not much noise so far. Maybe the PDC next year will be louder! More content to follow, and tomorrow pictures and videos!</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:fcd01037-c47b-4f97-bef5-30095e7830ed" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd" rel="tag">TechEd</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd-Developers" rel="tag">TechEd-Developers</a></div>
