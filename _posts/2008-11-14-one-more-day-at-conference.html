<p>And one more night of discussion, passion and learning. I get so much from meeting the people that attend conferences that I really think that not attending the sessions and only meeting people at dinner is where the value really is. I may just do that next year and skip the conf itself, and reserve myself for dinners, drinks and beer chatting.</p>
