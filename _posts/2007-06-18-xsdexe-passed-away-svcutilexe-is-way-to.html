<p>I was reading Darren David's blog entry on <a href="http://blog.lookorfeel.com/index.php/2007/05/02/the-net-xml-schema-definition-tool-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-parsing-and-love-the-dom-part-1/">code generation from xsd files</a>. Sadly, he references xsd.exe that generates Xml serialization code.</p> <p>If you're using .net 3, the new kid on the block is svcutil.exe that will generate real DataContracts that will give you a smooth path to Indigo (hmmm, WCF).</p> <p>Sadly, the documentation focuses mainly on generating the client code rather than the DataContract serialization code. There is one page detailing the process: <a href="http://blog.lookorfeel.com/index.php/2007/05/02/the-net-xml-schema-definition-tool-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-parsing-and-love-the-dom-part-1/">Importing Schema to Generate Classes</a>. Choose to not generate the client and only generate data contracts from your xsd schema and you'll be done, the v3 way.</p>
