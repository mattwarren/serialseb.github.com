<p>Just upgraded my development environment, here's the picture.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/TheTechnologist/SB2MPZKTjUI/AAAAAAAAADE/ZhZx3vYEgjo/s1600-h/013%5B4%5D.jpg"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="381" alt="013" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/TheTechnologist/SB2MP5KTjVI/AAAAAAAAADM/9R8lzLziWFE/013_thumb%5B2%5D.jpg?imgmax=800" width="501" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>The laptop looks tiny next to the screen, but it is in fact a high res MacBook Pro, 1920x1200, driving as a secondary screen an Apple Cinema Display 30&quot; for an added 2560 x 1600.</p>  <p>That's freakin' <strong>6.4 megapixels</strong> of vista goodness! Surprisingly enough, Aero runs without a hitch.</p>  <p>Couple of other interesting points: new apple keyboard as I fell in love with the feel of the MBA keyboard, the mouse is not the one i usually have (but ran out of batteries). And Prada sunglasses for the one day of sun we've had in London so far.</p>  <p>As for drinks, the coffee mug is the property of the client at which I keep this equipment, and the can of Redbull kinda explains the name behind my company name: caffeine IT :)</p>
