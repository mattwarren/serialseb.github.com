<p><em>[Update: Hotmail reactivated the account within 24 hours. I do like a bit of drama...]</em></p>  <p>My hotmail account has been suspended... If you've tried to reach me on <a href="mailto:seb@serialseb.com">seb@serialseb.com</a> from this morning, I'm in the hands of some sort of automatic processing that believes I'm a spammer... My account has been closed!</p>  <p>Considering the only emails I send are to my family, my work and the alt.net community, and that's at most 20 emails a day, you start wondering what the heck is going on!</p>  <p>I'll keep you posted. If anyone is working at hotmail, a bit of help would be appreciated!</p>  <p>Oh well, I'll have some road stories for the alt.net conference in a few hours. For the Londoners see you there!</p>
