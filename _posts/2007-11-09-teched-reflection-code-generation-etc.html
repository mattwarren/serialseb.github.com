<p>I'm sitting in Roy Osherove's session on lightweight code generation. Roy is a formidable speaker, but there's probably a bit too much content and some areas are, I believe, not explained in enough depth to be approachable by neophytes.</p> <p>Overall, a very good session with a lot of deep content, and a great overview of what is new in .net 2.0. However a lot of the focus is on solving real problems through these technologies, and a good dose of DLR and expression trees discussion would probably have been a great and smooth transition to the rest of what we've seen this whole week.</p> <p>And Roy is singing <em>I don't want to blog about it.</em> What an extraordinary end to a very good talk!</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4c138d1f-8d0d-4eef-a318-c8b3a656bda0" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd-Developers" rel="tag">TechEd-Developers</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd" rel="tag">TechEd</a></div>
