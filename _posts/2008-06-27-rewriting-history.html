<p>I very often update and modify my posts until I feel they carry the meaning I intended. With English being a foreign language to me, there are many instances where my posts end-up being interpreted the wrong way or don't represent my message really well.</p>  <p>I'll be migrating this blog over to my own servers quite soon, and I've been wondering if all those edits should be done the way they are now, without history, or if I should adopt a more bliki approach and leave anyone to see the variations and edits I do on posts.</p>  <p>Does historic truth matters to you? Do you want to see my edits? Or do you only care about the end result?</p>
