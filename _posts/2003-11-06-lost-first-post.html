title: Lost first post
---

<p>
   You know how it is, you start writing a huge entry, then midlessly click and bam,
   you loose your blog entry. How <strong>frustrating</strong>. One more reason to drop
   the browser completely and shift to a new <u><font color=#ff0000>paradigm</font></u>.

   In the meantime, you'll have to wait till tonight for me to post anything interesting
   :)

   Oh, yeah, don't consider that to be my first post, just my post 0. (I live in a c#
   woooooooorld).
