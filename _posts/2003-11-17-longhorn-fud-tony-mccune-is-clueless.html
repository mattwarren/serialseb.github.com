      Never heard of Open licenses? Microsoft is doing a lot of work to provide for suitable
      packages. Oh, and saying people only use Word&#8230; Maybe you&#8217;ve been independent
      for too long and don&#8217;t remember how real people work in an office.</span>

      <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Myth #2</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:
      This guy is absolutely insane. He goes on and on saying how Microsoft is locking you
      on the server side with Longhorn. Hello Mr McCune, if you attended the PDC, or even
      took some information on it before writing this, you would know Longhorn (and you
      ARE talking about Longhorn there aren&#8217;t you) is a client platform. Talking about
      &#8220;You&#8217;ll have the freedom to use your choice of middleware and hardware,
      including Windows&#8221; to my mother might be interesting and a compelling reason
      to choose Linux. If he was talking about writing software for real people out there,
      well, I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to do a reality check Mr. McCune, doing client
      side software in Java is not compelling for anyone at the moment, unless you want
      to sell it to people who share an ideology with you. Yeah, try to write 3d ui, video,
      real time compositing UIs using Java (or Win32 for that matter) and come back after
      your reality check.</span>

      <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Myth #3</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:
      See above. &#8220;Java has made great strides in usability&#8221;, I beg you pardon?
      Are you talking about the so called Community Process? Now this is interesting. As
      for Java not being tied to a platform&#8230; Do you have any, and I say ANY, non trivial
      J2EE application that can be moved between two application servers? Reality check
      again. I wouldn&#8217;t publish on ZDNet saying that I can swap my Microsoft .net
      components on Mono without carefully planning to do so. And I wouldn&#8217;t do it
      for an already written server side application. You know why? Cause I wouldn&#8217;t
      even want to see the light of day again, by fear of being looked at the stupid Java
      Zealot bragging about a product without even knowing what it&#8217;s all about.</span>

      <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Myth #4</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:
      Alright, a few things here. First of all, learn how to read. That would be handy.
      Not three, but two versions. First, <b>Whidbey</b> (and not <b>Whidby</b>) will be
      released next year with a version 2.0 of the framework, available on all supported
      .net platforms. Then, a Longhorn <b>Orcas</b> version (Not <b>Oracas</b>) that will
      feature Longhorn specific tools for the Longhorn specific API. Can you develop using
      an old version of the language on the new version of the framework? Yes you can run
      the programs, compile the programs, use the programs, and publish the programs. You
      can also run each of these versions at the same time. Or just use all of these applications
      with a single framework version. Best thing is, you say &#8220;Developers must continually
      update their skills which costs customers time and money&#8221;. Interesting, how
      you as a consultant would see Developers having to learn new things as a bad thing?
      Or are you out of job because you&#8217;re still thinking Java will change the world?
      Yeah, more likely.</span>

      <b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Myth #5</span></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">:
      Excuse me, IBM wrote an OS running on anything from a hand held to a mainframe? This
      is really interesting. Oh, you meant Linux? Like you can use GIMP out of the box from
      an iPaq? Oh, prove it; I&#8217;d love to see that.<br>
      And if you did go to the PDC (Please show me the ticket, I&#8217;d love to know where
      you were hidden for your absolute lack of knowledge makes me believe you could have
      been locked in a toilet with <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1267.aspx">this
      guy</a>), you would know for sure that the whole SOA and Web Services stack (<b>Indigo</b>,
      which I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love to write <b>Indigeno</b>) &nbsp;is done by
      IBM and Microsoft using common protocols that are published standards. But it cannot
      be otherwise, as 50% of it comes from IBM which &#8220;are agnostic and run on virtually
      every operating system and device&#8221;&#8230; Wait wait, you mean that each service
      will be able to talk to a Mainframe, an iPaq and windows? Welcome to the real world.</span>

   <p>
      <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In the name of the sane Development
      community, I would advise anyone who survived the reading of that piece of flame to
      discard it, make a lot of fun about the clueless author, and blame ZDNet for letting
      that kind of articles from getting through. Even Slashdot wouldn&#8217;t have published
      something that clueless. </span>
