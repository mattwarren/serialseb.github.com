<p>Sorry to all people reading (and not taken over by tweeter fever). Between PDC and KaizenConf, I took a couple of days off and am now getting ready to meet even more great people in TechEd.</p>  <p>I’m doing the initial edit for some of the videos I took at KaizenConf / PDC (mainly recording of sessions, the interviews will take a bit longer). I hope to manage to get a few more at TechEd. Bittorrent of the raw material to follow.</p>  <p>Oh, and I still don’t have a contract, so any work you feel I may be able to help out with, please shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:seb@serialseb.com">seb@serialseb.com</a>. Thanks!</p>
