<p>Lester just announced (well, on Wednesday but I have a big backlog because I spend my time reading the alt.net chat) <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/llobo/archive/2007/12/19/xamlpadx-v3-0.aspx">XamlPadX 3.0</a>. I know we didn't use the tool on my previous WPF projects, but I think it's the only XAML quick and easy tool that has seen an update recently. Will need to have a play during the festive season!</p>
