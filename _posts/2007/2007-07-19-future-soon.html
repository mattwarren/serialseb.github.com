<p>After a nice time at <a href="http://www.akqa.com">AKQA</a>, I'm off in a week time to a big media company for some super duper secret WPF project I obviously won't talk about. But that means WPF content is going to re-surface <em>en force</em>. My WPF tips'n'tricks need to be followed on.</p> <p>And thanks to the comments and emails I've received from some of the people reading me, if I've been of any help then it's all worth it.</p> <p>Oh, and I bought a new high resolution MacBook Pro, fantastic Vista development machine!
