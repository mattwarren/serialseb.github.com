<p>Just a quick note, as I've not been very active on this blog for the last few weeks. I still have a lot of content in the pipeline so expect a new tips'n'tricks article next week. I've been preparing some stuff to publish at TechEd as well, so if you are going to be around let me know I'll show you some fun stuff.</p> <p>Also I'll be releasing a tool to help work with sql express user instances and attached database files that I've been working on. Hopefully you'll find this useful.</p> <p>Stay tuned...</p>
