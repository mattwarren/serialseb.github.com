<p>Some of you may remember <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/01/attached-events-by-example-adding.html">my article on attached events</a>. There's now <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wpfsdk/archive/2007/05/09/dark-secrets-of-the-wpf-sdk-exposed.aspx">more clarification from the WPF SDK blog</a>. Considering the extensive email exchange I had with Wolf Schmidt about the topic and its coverage in the SDK, I wouldn't be surprised if he had something to do with that article. An excerpt from our conversation is in order.</p> <blockquote> <p>Now that I've spent so much time on an email to one individual customer, I think I smell a WPF SDK blog entry coming :-)</p></blockquote> <p>The point is, the MSDN people are very accessible and very helpful, and answer with passion and accuracy. And they hang on the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=119&amp;SiteID=1">WPF forum</a> as well so don't hesitate to drop your questions there.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:45b7ff8f-8016-4765-a2e3-0a80eec3d074" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net3" rel="tag">.net3</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/xaml" rel="tag">xaml</a></div>
