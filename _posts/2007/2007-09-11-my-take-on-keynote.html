<p>Overall I'm feeling a tiny bit let down. The demos were cool, but nothing very new or very exciting, except of course for adventureworks and the free silverlight hosting and streaming.</p> <p>Some of the presentations failed to impress me much, with the video player for the government and the tax cut presentations being the least impressive. The video player suffered a bit of scrubbing, was it due to the presentation environment I couldn't tell, but definitely no wow factor there. The forms application was much more form processing oriented, something you'd have expected for a more business intelligence talk rather than a designer / developer conference.</p> <p>But then again everybody knows I moan a lot. :)</p>
