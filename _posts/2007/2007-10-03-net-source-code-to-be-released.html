<p>From ScottGu, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx">the source code for the .net framework libraries is going to be released</a>, and on a source code server. This is thrilling news. Makes me regret spending all this time within WPF internals through reflector! Does that include comments in the source files?</p>
