I was reading the wpfbox blog about <a href="http://wpfbox.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/silverlight-more-than-a-name/">the MIX07 announcement regarding Silverlight </a>(the new name for WPF/E).

Well if this is the one you're talking about, we've known for some time that wpf/e would include a derivative of the micro CLR that already ran on the short lived SPOT devices, and a lot of work has gone through enabling CLS compliant languages to run on an embbed version of the CLR.

My best bet is that compiled IL will be presented at MIX07, together with a beta. Maybe there will even be full interop between IL code and javascript code, letting you call objects coded in C# using javascript.
