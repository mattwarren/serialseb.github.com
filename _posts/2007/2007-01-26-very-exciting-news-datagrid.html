<p>Xceed just released <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/wpfsdk/archive/2007/01/25/free-datagrid-for-wpf-by-xceed.aspx">version 1 of their DataGrid</a>. We're super excited here, as it would mean not having to invest in writting our own for the functionality we need. We'll have to see if it's flexible enough to do what we want. Stay tuned!</p>
