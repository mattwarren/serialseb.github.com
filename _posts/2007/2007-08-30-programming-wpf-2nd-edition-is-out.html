<p>Well through Chris Sell's blog, <a title="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2122" href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2122">http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2122</a>, the new edition is shipping. I liked the previous version, only real reference at the time I started WPF, together with the Petzold.</p> <p>So I just placed an order for it, and at the same time ordered Nathan's and the other Chris book, so I can have a go at reading them all.</p> <p>I'll do a comparison of all of them and report here. It's been done before but now that I've been working professionally for what seems like years but is in fact&nbsp;only a&nbsp;year (between the&nbsp;RTM and beta 2), I think I may see things differently.</p> <p>It will also be fun to compare the first and the 2nd edition of Programming WPF :)</p> <p>Question is, should I order the 3D Petzold? We'll see after I'm done with the rest.</p> <p>Anyone wants to commission me to write <em>"Writing controls for WPF: Put some sparkle in your cider!"</em>?</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:7143098f-1fca-4cb4-9ba0-263e56c43857" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/WPF" rel="tag">WPF</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Books" rel="tag">Books</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/XAML" rel="tag">XAML</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net3" rel="tag">.net3</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net35" rel="tag">.net35</a></div>
