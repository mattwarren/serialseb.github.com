<p>Just received this morning as part of my review of all the major WPF books, and what a shock. The first edition was quite short, the second is 800 pages!</p> <p>Half way through the ChrisA, and quarter of the way in Nathan's, i'll do the Petzold last so I expect to be reading Ian &amp; Sells book sometime in the next two weeks.</p>
