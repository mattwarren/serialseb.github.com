<p>Just received this morning as part of my review of all the major WPF books, and what a shock. The first edition was quite short, the second is 800 pages!</p> <p>Half way through the ChrisA, and quarter of the way in Nathan's, i'll do the Petzold last so I expect to be reading Ian &amp; Sells book sometime in the next two weeks.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:40a8dd63-863d-41a0-88c4-7b8a53faafb1" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net3" rel="tag">.net3</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net35" rel="tag">.net35</a></div>
