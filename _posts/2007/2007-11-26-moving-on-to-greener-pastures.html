<p>After a very successful run of technological achievements on my current project, it seems there's human incompatibilities that can't be patched and I am to suffer a cold reboot. As one of my previous clients wants me to work on some of their projects, I'll suffer only minor downtime. I can't say the same for this project I've not even been asked to do a handover for, but I wish all the best success to the team I've worked with, as I know that, with the IT people, everything ran smoothly and we did well. They will do well. Farewell.</p>  <p>In the meantime I'm taking a week off, so I'll be able to post the content I've had pending for a while, including MVP, SQL user instances and more WPF stuff.</p>
