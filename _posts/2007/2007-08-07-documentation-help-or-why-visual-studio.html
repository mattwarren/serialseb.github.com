<p>Visual Studio 2005 has the terrible habit of opening the full msdn library whenever you press F1, which in my case is mostly accidental. Not that I don't need help, but the F1 is a reflex I use when I don't understand the meaning of an option on the UI. I couldn't care less for msdn at that point.</p> <p>Visual Studio 2008 seems to have a faster <em>&lt;cough&gt; &lt;cough&gt; </em><strong>documentation explorer</strong>, but goes into what I'd consider to be pure vice: The little question mark box next to the close button is <strong>for bloody contextual help</strong>. Guess what, opening your big document explorer in my face when I'm already trying to understand what&nbsp;in the name of god you meant by <em>allow checked-in items to be edited</em> is not <strong>contextual</strong>. I loose my patience, and definitely loose my respect for whichever manager decided that after all, contextual help could be in the big documentation.</p> <p>Can I have my tooltips back? Please?</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:b08e13c8-2d26-4fbb-a728-589ec879c76b" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net" rel="tag">.net</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net3" rel="tag">.net3</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/visual%20studio%202008" rel="tag">visual studio 2008</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/orcas" rel="tag">orcas</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/software" rel="tag">software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/rumblings" rel="tag">rumblings</a></div>
