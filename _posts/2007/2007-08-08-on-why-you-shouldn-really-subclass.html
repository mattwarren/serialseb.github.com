<p>As I am reviewing some code at the moment, I have been looking for this blog entry from Rob for a while, and just found it again: <a href="http://rrelyea.spaces.live.com/Blog/cns!167AD7A5AB58D5FE!2130.entry">Building a control which holds content: CustomControl vs. MarkupSubclassing vs. UserControl</a>. Included in my specification references, but posting it so I can reuse it as a reference.</p> <p>And the ever so useful Neil (when are you getting a blog back?) points me to an article by Kevin on the same subject: <a href="http://work.j832.com/2007/06/don-subclass-panel-unless-you-making.html">Don't subclass a Panel, unless you're making a Panel</a>.</p> <p>It always amazes me that people, after x years of OOD, still don't see a problem in using inheritance instead of combination / encapsulation.</p> <p>Then again these guidelines postdate most of the uses I've seen so far so you can't really blame anyone.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:d940b4f0-3e34-4a19-ae9b-44186a15bed1" contenteditable="false" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/wpf" rel="tag">wpf</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net3" rel="tag">.net3</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/.net35" rel="tag">.net35</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/avalon" rel="tag">avalon</a></div>
