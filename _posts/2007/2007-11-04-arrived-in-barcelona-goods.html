<p><a title="DSC00015" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17917697@N03/1870297423/"><img alt="DSC00015" src="http://static.flickr.com/2305/1870297423_849a4eed5e.jpg" align="right" border="0"></a>Got in Barcelona alright. Had a goo time so far. Big bag of good with yet another unwearable t-shirt. Am I the only skinny person attending these conferences? An XL t-shirt when you wear XS is ludicrous.</p> <p>Here's a picture with all this content. Look at the size of this tshirt, it's mental! It's probably going to join the rank of numerous ones that I use exclusively for DIY.</p> <p>The bag is cool though, very good quality, and such an obvious tool to make your colleagues jealous when you go back to the office. I'll keep my Muji though, I like my bags like I like <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">my laptops</a>: slim.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:e44a3cae-a15d-404a-89c5-905abcd17687" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Teched-Developers" rel="tag">Teched-Developers</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd-Developers" rel="tag">TechEd-Developers</a></div>
