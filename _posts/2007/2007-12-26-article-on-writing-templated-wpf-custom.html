<p>This is something that we had to discover with reflector when I wrote the Excel-like control we used for the National Express WPF application, so it's good to see people writing about it, especially when it's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/08/01/Foundations/default.aspx">Charles Petzold</a> in msdn magazine.</p>  <p>An additional thing you might want to do is have properties defining the templates for different sub-elements used by defining a dependency property of type DataTemplate. You may also want to create new sub-controls, e.g. a CellPresenter, that you can add to the template to define where in the template other components of your control will get injected.</p>  <p>That should probably be an article in its own right. Maybe this weekend if I recover from my sore throat.</p>
