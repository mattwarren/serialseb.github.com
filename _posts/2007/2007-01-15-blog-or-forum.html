<p>I've not been very active updating this blog. First, I'm in the process of setting up another blog that would support some stuff I have pending, and on my own domain name. Plus it would be nice to re-upload my old archives of entries and without controlling the code it's gonna be hard.</p> <p>Second issue for me, and the major one, is that my time is extremely limited as we're all working very hard on the project we're working on at the moment (WPF of course). And it comes down to a choice to make between my blog and my contributions in the msdn forum.</p> <p>So for now, you can find me on <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=119&amp;SiteID=1">the msdn wpf forum</a>. I genuinely think my time is better spent there for the next few weeks, until the new blog arrives!</p>
