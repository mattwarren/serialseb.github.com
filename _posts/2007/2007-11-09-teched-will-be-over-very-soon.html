<p>I'm not taking the plane until tomorrow, but it's very sad to see everyone starting to leave. The exhibition center is closed. Only one talk remain where I'll go and have a chat with Roy Osherove.</p> <p>What to do tonight? I've not managed to learn about any parties, maybe tonight will be the first night where I can see Barcelona. Or maybe not.</p> <p>To be fair, I am tired, my brain is close to exhaustion with all the talks, arguments and chatting that's been going through, and I want to go back to my partner and have a relaxing weekend. Which means suffering the plane tomorrow morning, an experience I'm pretty sure I won't enjoy: I have a ticket for the evening but *need* to arrive in the middle of the afternoon in London.</p> <p>Oh the fun!</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:bdf32c46-0953-47a5-b016-4b9f1d73451d" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd-Developers" rel="tag">TechEd-Developers</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/TechEd" rel="tag">TechEd</a></div>
