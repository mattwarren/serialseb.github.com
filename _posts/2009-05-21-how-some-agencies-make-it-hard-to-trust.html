<p>I just received an email from Computer People, telling me “we agreed that I would keep in touch and update you with any further opportunities and developments around SharePoint”. I’m pretty sure that’s factually inaccurate, as I have very little interest in SharePoint development and certainly wouldn’t agree on the phone to be contacted for marketing reasons. But fair enough, if it was to help me find new clients, I wouldn’t be that bothered. But no! It’s to try and sell me sharepoint seminars! For Christ’s bullocks’ sake!</p>  <p>So off to my sent items, in which I keep years and years of emails (roughly since 2001), and of course I find absolutely no mention of that Dan Freshwater that just sent me an email, so emails are out.</p>  <p>Leaves only their website, maybe I subscribed to that and forgot to check the “do not contact me for marketing purposes” option. Although I’m very anal about always making sure I check that box, on paper forms or online, mistake is human so I may have not seen it. Or maybe it wasn’t there. Who knows.</p>  <p>The email goes on to try and sell me a seminar for SharePoint. So off to the website to check Computer People’s privacy policy, and here’s what I found.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>You can exercise the right at any time by contacting us at Legal Services, 71 Elstree Way, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, WD6 1WD.</p> </blockquote>  <p>What, legal services doesn’t have computers? Designing an option in your profile was too hard? Or are you making this difficult on purpose? Seeing as you lost my trust at the very beginning by saying I asked to receive marketing information about SharePoint, I’ll go for the last option.</p>  <p>Email was sent asking to not ever receive marketing emails again. We shall see if it has an effect, and I’ll be sure to report.</p>
