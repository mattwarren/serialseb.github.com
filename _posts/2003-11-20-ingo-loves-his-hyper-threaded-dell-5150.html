      I just wanted to blog it before Ingo does&#8230; 
   </p>
   <p>
      He&#8217;s been <a href="http://www.ingorammer.com/weblog/archives/001350.html">waiting</a> for
      his Dell for a few days, got it, and started installing everything. And now he&#8217;s
      crazy over Hyper-threading. And you know how I know it? Just because his messenger
      name changed. This might become a new form of communication.
