title: More on Longhorn FUD
---

<p>
   It seems my little entry generated quite a lot of feedback. Mostly I've been accused
   of just trusting Bill Gates word on groundless discussion. So here is a second post,
   facts, just facts mam.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Myth #1</strong>: 
</p>
<p>
   Fact: People in an office use more than word, whoever they are. Where can you see
   it? In any office, including mine. You want some pictures?
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Microsoft is remodeling their licenses to try to give more choice. But they
   are not always successful, can do some mistakes. Where:

</p>
<p>
   <strong>Myth #2</strong>:
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Longhorn is a client side platform, not an API. WinFX is an API for the client
   side. Indigo is for both the client and the server side. You can use Longhorn to access
   an LDAP directory and a Web Service GXA stack sitting on a server running another
   platform.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Longhorn is windows, so you develop software for windows. And people like it.
   No one really cares about having the 3d accelerated Desktop Composition Engine running
   on Linux.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Java can't do that.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Middleware doesn't have anything to do with Longhorn.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Middleware can be inter-operable through GXA and Web Services, in an inter-operable
   way.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Myth #3</strong>:
</p>
<p>
   Fact: The Java Community Process is plainly slow at defining new standards to improve
   the language.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
   Fact: Microsoft and Java are both innovating, but they are on different release cycles.
   Oh, that, and Longhorn is not .net and Longhorn can still run Java. Doesn't have anything
   to do with the underlying Longhorn API (WinFX).
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Myth #4</strong>:
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Visual studio versions road map.
</p>
<p>
   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Side by side execution works.
</p>

</p>
<p>
   Fact: the framework provide compatibility.
</p>
<p>

   <br>
   "The .NET Framework supports both backward and forward compatibility"
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Developers must learn new things all the time, this is only a question of staying
   competitive. This has nothing to do with how much you charge your clients. And it's
   true for windows, for java, for Linux, for any single piece of software on this planet.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Myth #5</strong>:
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Linux cannot run out of the box on any platform. The kernel can be modified
   to support it.
</p>
<p>
   <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php">http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php</a>
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Windows doesn't run everywhere. The kernel can be modified to be re-targeted.
   XBox, Windows on IA-32, IA-64, AMD64, and in the past PowerPC and MIPS. Looking forward,
   XBox2 on the G5 processor.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: The WS-* specifications on top of which Indigo is built are done by Microsoft,
   IBM, BEA, TIBCO, etc... For example, WS-ReliableMessaging states the following:
</p>
<p>
   <font face="Courier New">WS-ReliableMessaging was published as a public specification
   on 13 March<br>
   2003. This is the first joint BEA/IBM/Microsoft/TIBCO Software publication<br>
   of the specification.'</font>
   <br>
</p>
<p>
   Fact: All of these specifications are provided to the community royalty free.
</p>
<p>
   Fact: Some are standardized by other groups. WS-Security by Oasis, for example.

   I think I brought enough facts on the table. Now if you really want to debunk the
   facts, please do it. (I'm starting to getting impatient at finally seeing a correct
   argument).
