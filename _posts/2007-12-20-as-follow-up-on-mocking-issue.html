<p>Over there on CodeBetter.com, David Hayden has posted <a href="http://codebetter.com/blogs/david.hayden/archive/2007/11/01/mvp-in-asp-net-development-with-just-the-promise-of-a-view.aspx">something about Model-View-Presenter</a> that is a typical example of the confusion I was talking about in my post on <a href="http://serialseb.blogspot.com/2007/12/why-mock-frameworks-suck-and-how-to.html">why mock frameworks suck</a>.</p>  <p>The interface wasn't mocked, what David did was to create a test double (a fake or a stub depending on how you look at it, but not a mock!) using a mock framework. Again, I don't object on the use of the mock framework (see my previous entry as to where my objection is), but I think we're muddying the water for everybody if we don't get the semantics correct.</p>  <p>Or am I really the only one thinking you should use the right tool for the right job?</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:4f921550-e302-4b02-b968-13457e62977e" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/UnitTesting" rel="tag">UnitTesting</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Mocks" rel="tag">Mocks</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/RhinoMock" rel="tag">RhinoMock</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/Model-View-Presenter" rel="tag">Model-View-Presenter</a></div>
