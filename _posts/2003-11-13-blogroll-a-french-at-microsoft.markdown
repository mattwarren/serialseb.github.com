Just wanted to say Hi! to Julien, a french working at Microsoft.

So, hi to you Julien, hope to meet you in Redmond soon!

For those of you not following, I'm french living in London and one way or another will be a proud Microsoft emplyee at some point in the future.

I'll do the first part of the history of the peer2peer bubble and what does it means now with Microsoft tonight. Stay tuned! (For my 3 subscribers).
