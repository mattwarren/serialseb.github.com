title: Installing XP Service Pack 2 RC1 & various stuff
---

<div class="Section1">
   <p>
      As my life is insignificant and just plain boring these days, I&rsquo;ve uninstalled
      beta2 of SP2 and am in the process of installing the RC1&hellip; To be honest, I&rsquo;ve
      been waiting for about 4 hours now, and I&rsquo;m still nowhere near the end, with
      a very high CPU usage&hellip; Thanks god for my laptop!

      I&rsquo;m not willing to disclose any spoiler, but I have a phone interview with an
      international company on Monday. I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled. Their teams are the
      top of the top in XP development and good in .net. To be honest, I&rsquo;ve learned
      that there are some psychometric tests over there, and after nearly a year working
      exclusively on psychometric tests, I know that I can&rsquo;t properly be evaluated
      by these, as it seems I&rsquo;m a 3d thinker... Or so told me one of the Doctors in
      psychology that I&rsquo;ve been working with. Well, we&rsquo;ll see. I won&rsquo;t
      say more about it before I get some kind of answer, but I&rsquo;m <b>really</b> excited <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span> 
   </p>
   <p>
      As a side note&hellip; I&rsquo;m back on the Microsoft newsgroups answering where
      I can help.
