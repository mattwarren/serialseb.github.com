<p><em>[Update: new location, see below]</em></p>  <p>Here's the latest development. The alt.net London Beers event is being moved!</p>  <p>Skills Matter is organizing <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/open-source-dot-net/agile-web-development-with-the-castle-framework">a talk by Gojko Adzic on the Castle Framework</a> on the day we originally planned for the drinks. As everybody has shown strong interest in attending both events, Skills Matter has been kind enough to help us organize the drinks in the Crown Pub in front of their office, so you can now attend both events.</p>  <p>Not only that, but they have also opened the possibility for another presentation on an alt.net subject, so if you feel like presenting, <a href="mailto:seb@serialseb.com">drop me a mail</a>!</p>  <p>I have to thank Catriona at Skills Matter for sponsoring the alt.net London Beers event and inviting all the alt.netters to attend the Castle presentation, as well as Gojko for suggesting the merge of the two events.</p>  <p>So here's the recap:</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>What</strong>: Alt.net London Beers #1 </li>    <li><strong>Where</strong>: <a href="http://www.priorybar.com/">The priory bar in St Johns Square</a>, right by Farringdon station</li>    <li><strong>When</strong>: 15th May 2008 from 20:30 </li> </ul>  <p>We'll probably move back to the planned Tottenham Court Road location for our second meet, on the 16th of June. Keep your calendars open!</p>
