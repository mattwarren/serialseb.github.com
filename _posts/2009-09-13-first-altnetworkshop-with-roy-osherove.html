I'm very glad to announce that we launched the <a href="http://altnetgroup.com/">AltNetGroup </a>website last week, and opened the first couple of tickets to the first AltNetWorkshop, something that I've been very keen on organizing. Roy has been generous enough, together with bbits and Onalytica, to give the first of our workshops for free.

The bad news is that the event date has changed, and is now handled on the 26th of September. The good news is that there will be another 5 tickets, of which two will be released on monday, and two additional ones on tuesday.

This leaves us with one last final ticket that will be picked randomly to all those sending me an email to <a href="mailto:seb@serialseb.com">seb@serialseb.com</a>.
