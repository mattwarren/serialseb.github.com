<p>While looking around for nice visual studio color schemes, I stumbled upon Commonality's <a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2008/02/06/NamingYourComputers.aspx">Naming your computers post</a>. I'm happy to know I'm not the only one doing that.</p>  <p>All the computers in Caffeine IT are named on the theme of light. Here's a rundown.</p>  <ul>   <li>Luciole, Lueur: decomissioned machines I had when in France</li>    <li>Aurore: A dell machine that I am now disposing off, mainly because I can't be bothered to rebuild it.</li>    <li>Tinkerbell: my main dev laptop, MacBook Pro running Vista Ultimate.</li>    <li>Photon: The MacBook Air running Vista Ultimate.</li>    <li>Lumiere: The Sony TP1E that is the test machine for my yet to be released Vista media integration software, and connected to the big LCD screen. Only way to test 3-feet user experience is to set-up a machine with no keyboard and no mouse, relying only on the remote. Running Vista Home Premium.</li>    <li>Blackhole: The custom-built Xeon machine that holds my dev environments and the multi-terabyte RAID5 array. Running Windows Server 2008 Core with Hyper-V</li>    <li>Glimmer: The build server, web uat environment, and other bits and bobs (server 2008 Standard)</li>    <li>Pulsar: The backup server (windows home server)</li>    <li>Hubble: A video streaming server on Windows Server 2003 R2.</li>    <li>RayOfLight: The iphone :)</li> </ul>  <p>And before you ask, of course I need that many. :)</p>
