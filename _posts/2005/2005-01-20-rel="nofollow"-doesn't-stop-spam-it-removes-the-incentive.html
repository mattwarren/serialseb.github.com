      I just saw (just before unsubscribing) Robert’s entry about the google nofollow attribute
      and how everybody, according to him, is wrong in thinking it will stop spam.

   <p class="ngpostlinks">
      <span style=''><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2005/01/19/356271.aspx" title="http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2005/01/19/356271.aspx">http://weblogs.asp.net/rmclaws/archive/2005/01/19/356271.aspx</a></span>

      Go and read the link, and come back here. Done?
   </p>
   <p>
      Well, the thing is, why do spammers use comments and referrers on blogs like yours?
      I don’t think it has anything to do with the spammer targeting your audience as being
      more interested in Viagra than the general public.
   </p>
   <p>
      It has to do with your high google juice. It has to do with the target web site going
      up in the google index. That’s the <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>only</span></b> reason
      they target blogs. They leverage google juice. They don’t care about your readers,
      and I really don’t think their intention is for your readers to follow the link.
   </p>
   <p>
      Removing the only reason why they target comment spam is a step in the right direction,
      and one that will be much more efficient than any blacklisting in the future. If antispam
      technology was built-in any mail client out there, I’m not sure we would see the same
      amount of spam being sent.
   </p>

      Only point where I’d agree with Robert is that it doesn’t replace a CAPTCHA tool (available
      on my blog thanks to dasBlog 1.7).
