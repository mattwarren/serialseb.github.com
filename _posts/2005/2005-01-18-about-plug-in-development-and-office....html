      Andrew <a href="http://blogs.officezealot.com/whitechapel/archive/2005/01/16/3862.aspx">writes</a> about
      the 40 (!!) different ways of writing a plug-in, and this is just for Office. 
   </p>
   <p>
      A quote that I find interesting and up to debate: 
   </p>
   <p style='margin-left:36.0pt'>
      <span style=';font-family:Arial'>Wouldn’t it be nice to have VSTO support for Outlook?
      Wouldn’t it be nice to have VSTO support for all Office apps, plus Visual Studio,
      Visio, and (let’s say) AutoCAD and PhotoShop? Wouldn’t it be nice to have a single,
      standard mechanism for loading add-ins/customizations/plug-ins into all Office applications,
      plus any other application that wants to play by the same rules?</span> 
   </p>
   <p>
      Well I think that what VBA was providing, and it was a great achievement. Anyone remember
      VSA? Visual Studio for Applications? Where did that project go? 
   </p>
   <p>
      I am not against common extensibility points, but the biggest issue with VBA, that
      I believe led to VSA’s failure, is the tight coupling between the <b><span style='font-weight:bold'>IDE</span></b> and
      the <b><span style='font-weight: bold'>toolkit</span></b>. Obviously, with VBA it
      was a winner. One language, one IDE, one integration story. But in the .net world,
      we have many languages that are not coupled with the IDE, issues like loading / unloading
      plug-ins dynamically, running them in their own AppDomain, different security models
      (although that’s pretty much resolved by policy), and as such, the problem of marshalling
      the object model of an application across an AppDomain, and the inherent disappearance
      of garbage collection (a fact sadly completely ignored by many). 
   </p>
   <p>
      So… would it be nice? Probably. But I would strongly suggest, for the toolkit side
      of things, that the framework need to involve (cross-AppDomain garbage collection
      when run in process anyone?), and the focus should be on a proper template system
      and a set of common interfaces for the toolkit part.

      For a limited case, there’s already an <a href="http://workspaces.gotdotnet.com/eap">Extensibility
      Application Block</a> from my friend <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/">Roy
      Osherove</a>.

      Any comments?
