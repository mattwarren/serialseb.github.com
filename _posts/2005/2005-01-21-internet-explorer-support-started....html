title: Internet Explorer support started...
---

I added some form of IE support using the <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/">IE7
javascript toolkit</a>... Now only thing left to fix for ie is the alpha blended png
i use as a background, and for all browsers make the web site a bit faster. Alpha
blended html elements are definitly getting the performance down!
