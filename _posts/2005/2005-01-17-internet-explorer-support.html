title: Internet Explorer support
---

As the few first people see the web page, I get pinged asking why it
looks so bad on Internet Explorer. As you can notice, no Javascript on
the page (except from what is generated by dasBlog), I use CSS 1 and 2.
Sadly the support for this and for alpha transparency in Internet
Explorer is lacking at best.<br>
<br>
I don't have time right now to implement an IE specific version, but I will try and
do so in the next couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
You'll also notice that I'm using feed: links everywhere instead of the default RSS
links. These are custom macros for dasBlog, so you can expect an article about that
in the next couple of days.<br>
