<p>I realize I’ve never clarified what you can or cannot do with my slides and my talks. So here’s a clarification for anyone that wishes to inspire themselves from my work (aka derivative works) or reuse them.</p>  <p>I do not release my presentations, the videos or the content / slides under any kind of open-source license. Not even creative commons. Presentations take a while to build, structure and mature, and this cost me money. If you’re going to use them, you’re effectively using my work.</p>  <p>Now, I’m not anal about how you use the content, it’s written to benefit the community. However, ff you want to create a derivative work, or even re-present my presentations, I’m happy for you to do so provided the following conditions are met:</p>  <ul>   <li>The original work author is to be named (that’s me), together with my company name (that’s Caffeine IT).</li>    <li>It would be terribly appreciated to link to the original content, or my blog, or both.</li>    <li>You notify me that you’re going to use the content, or created a derivative work.</li> </ul>  <p>If you have any issue with any of that, don’t hesitate to send me an email we can chat about it.</p>
