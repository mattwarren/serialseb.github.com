<p>My hotmail is back apparently... we'll never know what happened. At the alt.net conference this morning... Early start after a very late evening. There are damn smart people in here, very uplifting.</p>  <p>Here's the sessions I'm going to attend:</p>  <ul>   <li>REST / SOAP / MVC and what it all means for services</li>    <li>Mocking, is it a good idea? (you know it's one of my pet peeves)</li>    <li>How to become a better developer and spread the alt.net ideas</li>    <li>DSL and fluent interfaces...</li> </ul>  <p>They're the bits I proposed in each of the topic-based subjects that are being grouped together...</p>  <p>It's my opinion that we should've had probably less topics proposed, and the decision on what stays and what doesn't should've been taken by the people that are here rather than pre-organized. It makes people passively vote for sessions with less self-organization. But maybe British people are just less proactive and expansive than our American counterparts.</p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:a1276364-cb19-4f9f-968e-81bc552bb41e" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/altdotnet" rel="tag">altdotnet</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/altnetuk" rel="tag">altnetuk</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/alt.net" rel="tag">alt.net</a></div>
