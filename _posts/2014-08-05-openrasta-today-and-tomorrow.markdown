The OpenRasta community has experienced a bit of a renaissance. And so it should, for there is much to rejoice about, and really cool stuff happening in the pipeline.

Because the time is right to reopen those communication channels we once had, the community is organising an OpenRasta MeetUp to talk about where we are and where we're going, with great presentations, nifty additions to the openrasta family and a few reveals of where we're going.

Come join us, at the just-eat offices, for an amazing evening of tech, beer and probably some food, on August the 22nd.
