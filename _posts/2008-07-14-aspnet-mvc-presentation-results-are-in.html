<p>The nice people at VBUG just sent me the result of the evaluation forms, and I am very pleased with the result, as a vast majority seems to have enjoyed the talk.</p>  <p>A couple of points were raised by an apparently unimpressed attendee, and as those forms are anonymous I thought I would take the time to provide some feedback here. </p>  <h4>The font size was too small to read from the back</h4>  <p> The font had been set to quite a big font size, added with a very large DPI. I'm afraid the length of the room compared to the size of the projector made it very difficult to accommodate everyone. If anyone has suggestions to reach to more people while still managing to put 30 characters in the wideness of the screen, I'd be very interested. Any experience from using different fonts? Maybe high contrast with dark background? I'd be quite interested in learning a few new tricks to make it work better.</p>  <p>That said, there were spaces on the front row, and I did ask everyone to confirm my font size was alright with them. I should have indicated this was a strong hint for people to reshuffle based on their sight :)</p>  <h4>Discover powerpoint, where are the diagrams? </h4>  <p>This one is quite accurate, I do not have powerpoint slides as a rule: unless I have something very compelling to show in a diagram I don't see a point in showing one. I had a slide introduction for the previous version of the asp.net MVC talk I did at DNUG, but I find them distracting and get the audience passive. Especially as for MVC I would end up showing either a product roadmap (I don't think it's my job) or a diagram of MVC, which in itself seems of poor value. </p>  <p>While pictures do speak a thousand words, I think code does speak more efficiently to most developers. So I'd be interested in knowing what people think. Do you prefer a screencast approach of demoing step by step what is going on, or have an introduction to the concept of MVC with nice diagrams, arrows, blocks and what not? I tried both and felt the tutorial approach worked better, but from the presenter side of things it's always difficult to make those judgement calls.</p>  <h4>Lots of mistakes in the demo</h4>  <p>Yeap, some glitches here and there happened. Some, like the exception thrown when a view is not found, were on purpose to demo a feature, some others were due to my poor typing. On an interesting note, when presenting just like when working, apologizing for something no one has complained about usually seems to trigger complains that otherwise would have been silent. From now on I think I'll stop apologizing for my typing errors and rely on my audience to correct me (which I really like because it means they're reading and understanding the code as I type it. Spot on!) </p>  <h4>The examples were poor</h4>  <p>Oh, I did like my Bingo game. I'm just sick and tired of the same stuff everyone does with Northwind / NotNorthwind / Southwind. Storefront is there to provide you with an end-to-end real demo and does it so well. I'll stick to my guns on that one, boring things are one of the reasons I don't work in the city anymore :)</p>  <h4>Conclusion</h4>  <p>What worries me slightly more is the discrepancy between speaker rates and overall session rates, which leads me to think the presentation itself was less than excellent. I think it really comes down to two issues: expectations should be managed to reflect the code-intensive nature of the presentation, and the content is probably slightly too complex, with too many points being presented, including containers, dependency injection, inversion of control, testability, c#, javascript, html, etc.</p>  <p>On the bright side, only one of you has not been satisfied by the content or the presenter, with 67% rating the session as Very Good or Excellent, and 72% rating me as Very Good or Excellent (see my head growing out of proportion!), so a massive thanks to all of you for making this the presentation I've enjoyed the most so far.</p>  <p>P.S. I seem to remember two people chatting and laughing away during parts of the presentation at the back of the room. A good thing I had my back to the audience the whole time or I would have given the eye. Presenters do put a lot of effort in preparing those sessions, if the content or the presenter doesn't interest you, I apologize for failing to make the subject interesting to you, but I'd rather you stayed quiet or left. The law of two feet should apply, even during a presentation.</p>
