title: The simple life of ReSTful Microservices
layout: talk
description: |
    Microservices are in, monolithic apps are out, everyone is high in the cloud,
    SOA is undead, ReSTful is never really ReSTful because pragmatism, and
    messaging is either really awesome or really bad. Very complicated, right?
    Complex systems are all around us, often made of many small and simple
    entities. In this talk we'll explore how complexity can be reduced to its
    smallest cohesive parts, communication normalized through the power of
    evolvable contracts, ReSTful and event-driven interfaces, and how to make
    a microservice swarm fly in unison.
