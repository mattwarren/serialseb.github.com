_Section under construction, bear with..._

Confused about what ReST is? Have a project where quality issues are preventing you from releasing? In need of a
fantastic trainer? Want to validate your architecture and coding practices to ensure the best possible use of your
existing development teams? Or maybe you want an exciting and vibrant speaker for your conference?

Look no further. With over 15 years of experience at the wheels of projects large and small, I can help you become the best you can be.

## Who is Sebastien Lambla

Sebastien Lambla has been involved in software development since receiving his first web browser, back in the days
 of Netscape Navigator 1.2. After a few years of hacking on javascript, he turned his attention to the .net platform,
 on which he would spend the next few years building software in many companies.

From 2006, Sebastien has been running Caffeine IT, a consultancy helping clients from all over Europe implement
 first-grade and innovative solutions.

Keen Open-Source promoter, Sebastien has created multiple high-profile open-source projects that are in use in many
Fortune 500 companies, including OpenRasta (2008), the most popular resource-oriented framework on .net, and OpenWrap (2010), an
 alternative package manager for the .net platform.

Long-time advocate of the ReST architectural style and resource-oriented computing, Sebastien has delivered over the
years new platforms leveraging the architecture of the web, from small independent companies to Enterprise-scale
architectures.

An [enticing and motivational speaker](/speaker/), Sebastien has delivered hundreds of talks, from small user-groups to
 some of the largest running European conferences.

Attentive and knowlegeable, Sebastien has also delivered hundreds of hours of training to classes of all sizes and
skills, on nHibernate, ReST, web technologies, distributed architectures and many other subjects.

Since April 2013, building on his experience designing and delivering resource-oriented architectures and his training
classes, Sebastien has started the writing of a book on the subject, Practical Rest, a project that is being restarted after a long hiatus.

## What people say


 > Seb is amazing. I've had him speak at my events and been lucky enough to hear him. He has an amazing way of enthusing passionately about a subject, that he obviously knows inside out, and is able to relate that to listners in a way they can understand. Seb really knows what he's doing in terms of heading up a team and taking them in a direction. He's a brilliant catalyst for change. His vision and architecture will take a team in a direction they'd have never dreamed of, on a journey to delivering valuable, incredible software. A leader in his field.

[Gemma Cameron](http://rubygem.me), Software Developer and Queen Bee of Manchester's Tech Community

 > I worked with Seb for nearly a year at a mutual client of ours; he demonstrated an enlightening depth of knowledge in his areas of expertise he is superb at spotting problems which can be solved with already discovered patterns. He has strong opinions on everything and is always willing to apply pragmatism when building software. He is worth hiring and always worth listening to - there are many things to be learned from him.

[Rob Ashton](http://codeofrob.com), Freelance software nomad

> Seb is an intelligent, respected, and accomplished technologist. He was a huge personal help to me in ramping up on REST and provide my team continual advice as we were developing ASP.NET Web API. He is also a passionate supporter of the UK developer community having also been a big driver for the UK alt.net efforts.

[Glenn Block](http://codebetter.com/glennblock), Program Manager

> Seb is articulate, passionate, courageous and fiercely intelligent; exactly the kind of person you want to have around
> if you've got difficult problems to solve. I enjoyed working with him immensely and wouldn't hesitate to do so again.

> I used OpenRasta during a code "boot-camp" to teach developers about ReST. We spent about 1 hour total talking about
> ReSt and some different theory. We then spent the next 3 hours showing and writing code. We created a basic CRUD
> style controller, put some basic authentication into the pipeline and had a working service up and running by the time
> the class was over. The feedback was great, and for most people it was easy to use OpenRasta to learn ReST.

Nate Taylor, developer

> Seb has always been a great inspiration to me. Being an API guy myself, I've always looked up to him and if it wasn't for OpenRasta I wouldn't be where I am in my career. Thanks for that!

Filip W, developer and all that

> Sebastien delivered an outstanding session about RESTful API:s and hypermedia during Øredev 2011. But what's equally
> important - he really took the time to hang around the conference talking and debating with any attendee that
> approached him. This is what makes a conference great, speakers, like Sebastien, that takes the time to have all those
> discussions between the sessions.

Peter von Lochow, Member of Program Committee, Öredev AB

> Expert, High Integrity, Creative

Colin Jack, developer

> Sebastien Lambla is purely brilliant! Not only is he extremely talented, but he is hard working and always well
> prepared and innovative. Most of the projects I had the pleasure of working with him on involved highly complex
> scenarios that were all presenting high risks. Sebastien always came to the table with innovative solutions that not
> only looked amazing, but worked perfectly. I would work with him again without hesitation.

Sebastien Rousseau, project manager, AKQA

> Sebastien is an excellent software developer with tremendous experience of delivering software with the latest
> techniques and technologies. He provides a real advantage to any customer or development team.

Daniel Fernandes, developer

> Seb brought a wealth of knowledge about WPF. Along with his excellent problem solving ability, he helped us develop a
> great application for our client.
