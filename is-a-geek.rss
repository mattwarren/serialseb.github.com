         As some of my beloved readers thinks I can’t give credit to someone slapping
         Longhorn, here is an article from eweek: 
      </p>

          </p>
          <p>
         This guy at least knows what Longhorn is and intend on being. A few comments though:
         (that’s why I have a blog you know, giving my opinion without anyone asking
         for it :-) )

         Longhorn provides more than just APIs. It’s more than a platform. It’s
         an entry in the world where being cool is as important as being technically challenging.
         Why? Because even people typing all day on their computer like nifty funny user interfaces.
         It’s not only about technical excellence, it is about bringing back some cool
         experience on the windows platform. 
      </p>
          <p>
         If you think about it, Microsoft is pretty clever. They know they would have a hard
         time convincing terminal mode guys and linux aficionados from going full way into
         an OS. They know Java and Linux can provide data entry user interfaces. To keep their
         advantage on the desktop, they have to go somewhere else, somewhere where people enjoy
         the cool factor. This is your mother, you, your children, maybe even your dog. Anyone
         who just likes it cool. Apple survived because of that coolness factor and are building
         their whole product line on it. Microsoft started doing it with windows xp, as a form
         of “will it work?”. Now that they know it does, they are going there full
         time.

         Now this is also where Microsoft and Sun differ a lot. Schzartz listen to consumers,
         and try to bring them exactly what they asked for, not more. Microsoft listen to their
         customer, but rather than trying to deliver features A and B, big teams are organized,
         design is done for the next 2 or 3 years, and A, B, C and D become part of a big plan,
         a big building block. This is what Indigo is, this is what Avalon is. This is looking
         into the future, not into what people want today.

          <p>
         Schwartz is absolutely right by saying that being an end node on the network is not
         enough. But now again, peer 2 peer technologies are there exactly to transform end
         nodes into central communicating nodes. And this is going to be integrated in windows.
         Just like JXTA is integrated in Java. (Stay tuned for my rants on the JXTA technology).

         Yes, the PC is only <b>one</b> of the devices we’re using. But it’s the
         most powerful, the most connected, the one we’re the most used to. If you get
         it even more compelling by providing rich interactive fun clients to deal with data,
         and let it integrate with any device anywhere at any time (WinFS Sync), then you’ve
         got the killer app. People won’t abandon their PC to switch to Java phones.

      <body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>
      It seems my little entry generated quite a lot of feedback. Mostly I've been accused
      of just trusting Bill Gates word on groundless discussion. So here is a second post,
      facts, just facts mam.
   </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Myth #1</strong>: 
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: People in an office use more than word, whoever they are. Where can you see
      it? In any office, including mine. You want some pictures?
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Microsoft is remodeling their licenses to try to give more choice. But they
      are not always successful, can do some mistakes. Where:
   </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/itspending/story/0,10801,72214,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/itspending/story/0,10801,72214,00.html</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Myth #2</strong>:
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Longhorn is a client side platform, not an API. WinFX is an API for the client
      side. Indigo is for both the client and the server side. You can use Longhorn to access
      an LDAP directory and a Web Service GXA stack sitting on a server running another
      platform.
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Longhorn is windows, so you develop software for windows. And people like it.
      No one really cares about having the 3d accelerated Desktop Composition Engine running
      on Linux.
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Java can't do that.
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Middleware doesn't have anything to do with Longhorn.
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Middleware can be inter-operable through GXA and Web Services, in an inter-operable
      way.
   </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Myth #3</strong>:
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: The Java Community Process is plainly slow at defining new standards to improve
      the language.
   </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=108119,00.asp">http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=108119,00.asp</a>
        </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Microsoft and Java are both innovating, but they are on different release cycles.
      Oh, that, and Longhorn is not .net and Longhorn can still run Java. Doesn't have anything
      to do with the underlying Longhorn API (WinFX).
   </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Myth #4</strong>:
   </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Visual studio versions road map.
   </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx</a>
        </p>
        <p>
      Fact: Side by side execution works.

      <pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2003 16:10:58 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
   It seems my little entry generated quite a lot of feedback. Mostly I've been accused
   of just trusting Bill Gates word on groundless discussion. So here is a second post,
   facts, just facts mam.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;Myth #1&lt;/strong&gt;: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: People in an office use more than word, whoever they are. Where can you see
   it? In any office, including mine. You want some pictures?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Microsoft is remodeling their licenses to try to give more choice. But they
   are not always successful, can do some mistakes. Where:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/itspending/story/0,10801,72214,00.html"&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/managementtopics/management/itspending/story/0,10801,72214,00.html&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;Myth #2&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Longhorn is a client side platform, not an API. WinFX is an API for the client
   side. Indigo is for both the client and the server side. You can use Longhorn to access
   an LDAP directory and a Web Service GXA stack sitting on a server running another
   platform.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Longhorn is windows, so you develop software for windows. And people like it.
   No one really cares about having the 3d accelerated Desktop Composition Engine running
   on Linux.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Java can't do that.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Middleware doesn't have anything to do with Longhorn.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Middleware can be inter-operable through GXA and Web Services, in an inter-operable
   way.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;Myth #3&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: The Java Community Process is plainly slow at defining new standards to improve
   the language.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=108119,00.asp"&gt;http://www.eweek.com/print_article/0,3048,a=108119,00.asp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Microsoft and Java are both innovating, but they are on different release cycles.
   Oh, that, and Longhorn is not .net and Longhorn can still run Java. Doesn't have anything
   to do with the underlying Longhorn API (WinFX).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;Myth #4&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Visual studio versions road map.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/productinfo/roadmap.aspx&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Side by side execution works.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/sidexsidenet.asp"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnnetdep/html/sidexsidenet.asp&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: the framework provide compatibility.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpovrversioncompatibility.asp"&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpguide/html/cpovrversioncompatibility.asp&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
   "The .NET Framework supports both backward and forward compatibility"
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Developers must learn new things all the time, this is only a question of staying
   competitive. This has nothing to do with how much you charge your clients. And it's
   true for windows, for java, for Linux, for any single piece of software on this planet.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;strong&gt;Myth #5&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Linux cannot run out of the box on any platform. The kernel can be modified
   to support it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;a href="http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php"&gt;http://www.handhelds.org/geeklog/index.php&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Windows doesn't run everywhere. The kernel can be modified to be re-targeted.
   XBox, Windows on IA-32, IA-64, AMD64, and in the past PowerPC and MIPS. Looking forward,
   XBox2 on the G5 processor.

   of the specification.'&lt;/font&gt;
   &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: All of these specifications are provided to the community royalty free.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Fact: Some are standardized by other groups. WS-Security by Oasis, for example.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   &amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   I think I brought enough facts on the table. Now if you really want to debunk the
   facts, please do it. (I'm starting to getting impatient at finally seeing a correct
   argument).

         This guy is absolutely insane. He goes on and on saying how Microsoft is locking you
         on the server side with Longhorn. Hello Mr McCune, if you attended the PDC, or even
         took some information on it before writing this, you would know Longhorn (and you
         ARE talking about Longhorn there aren’t you) is a client platform. Talking about
         “You’ll have the freedom to use your choice of middleware and hardware,
         including Windows” to my mother might be interesting and a compelling reason
         to choose Linux. If he was talking about writing software for real people out there,
         well, I’m afraid you’ll have to do a reality check Mr. McCune, doing client
         side software in Java is not compelling for anyone at the moment, unless you want
         to sell it to people who share an ideology with you. Yeah, try to write 3d ui, video,
         real time compositing UIs using Java (or Win32 for that matter) and come back after
         your reality check.</span>

         See above. “Java has made great strides in usability”, I beg you pardon?
         Are you talking about the so called Community Process? Now this is interesting. As
         for Java not being tied to a platform… Do you have any, and I say ANY, non trivial
         J2EE application that can be moved between two application servers? Reality check
         again. I wouldn’t publish on ZDNet saying that I can swap my Microsoft .net
         components on Mono without carefully planning to do so. And I wouldn’t do it
         for an already written server side application. You know why? Cause I wouldn’t
         even want to see the light of day again, by fear of being looked at the stupid Java
         Zealot bragging about a product without even knowing what it’s all about.</span>

         Alright, a few things here. First of all, learn how to read. That would be handy.
         Not three, but two versions. First, <b>Whidbey</b> (and not <b>Whidby</b>) will be
         released next year with a version 2.0 of the framework, available on all supported
         .net platforms. Then, a Longhorn <b>Orcas</b> version (Not <b>Oracas</b>) that will
         feature Longhorn specific tools for the Longhorn specific API. Can you develop using
         an old version of the language on the new version of the framework? Yes you can run
         the programs, compile the programs, use the programs, and publish the programs. You
         can also run each of these versions at the same time. Or just use all of these applications
         with a single framework version. Best thing is, you say “Developers must continually
         update their skills which costs customers time and money”. Interesting, how
         you as a consultant would see Developers having to learn new things as a bad thing?
         Or are you out of job because you’re still thinking Java will change the world?
         Yeah, more likely.</span>

         Excuse me, IBM wrote an OS running on anything from a hand held to a mainframe? This
         is really interesting. Oh, you meant Linux? Like you can use GIMP out of the box from
         an iPaq? Oh, prove it; I’d love to see that.<br />
         And if you did go to the PDC (Please show me the ticket, I’d love to know where
         you were hidden for your absolute lack of knowledge makes me believe you could have
         been locked in a toilet with <a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1267.aspx">this

         which I’m sure you’ll love to write <b>Indigeno</b>)  is done by
         IBM and Microsoft using common protocols that are published standards. But it cannot
         be otherwise, as 50% of it comes from IBM which “are agnostic and run on virtually
         every operating system and device”… Wait wait, you mean that each service

      an iPaq? Oh, prove it; I&amp;#8217;d love to see that.&lt;br&gt;
      And if you did go to the PDC (Please show me the ticket, I&amp;#8217;d love to know where
      you were hidden for your absolute lack of knowledge makes me believe you could have
      been locked in a toilet with &lt;a href="http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/1267.aspx"&gt;this
      guy&lt;/a&gt;), you would know for sure that the whole SOA and Web Services stack (&lt;b&gt;Indigo&lt;/b&gt;,
      which I&amp;#8217;m sure you&amp;#8217;ll love to write &lt;b&gt;Indigeno&lt;/b&gt;) &amp;nbsp;is done by
      IBM and Microsoft using common protocols that are published standards. But it cannot
      be otherwise, as 50% of it comes from IBM which &amp;#8220;are agnostic and run on virtually
      every operating system and device&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; Wait wait, you mean that each service
      will be able to talk to a Mainframe, an iPaq and windows? Welcome to the real world.&lt;/span&gt; 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In the name of the sane Development
      community, I would advise anyone who survived the reading of that piece of flame to
      discard it, make a lot of fun about the clueless author, and blame ZDNet for letting
      that kind of articles from getting through. Even Slashdot wouldn&amp;#8217;t have published
      something that clueless. &lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="Section1"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      Hello dear readers, as promised, the first part of my peer 2 peer history. I&amp;#8217;ll
      try to remember what happened since I started being involved in this movement, and
      will go up to seeing what Microsoft is planning with Longhorn. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      What exactly is peer2peer? To put it simply, a peer 2 peer technology enables communication
      between computers with nearly no intervention form a server. Another explanation would
      be that, in a perfect p2p world, there would be no client, and only servers. Basically,
      what the web was before dial-up ISP appeared. The internet was a p2p architecture
      at its heart. So, why the focus in 2000 on this &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; peer to peer architecture?
      Because&amp;#8230; 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      A long time ago, Napster was released. I won&amp;#8217;t go through why and how it appeared
      or why and how it got crushed. Napster was a so-called p2p application, that let people
      connect to a server to know what files other people are sharing, and download these
      files directly from these other people. Technically, napster had nothing interesting
      to talk about, so I won&amp;#8217;t go through it. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      A short while after the Napster, a new software, gnutella, was released by Nullsoft.
      The story of gnutella is quite interesting. To put it short, it was published, lasted
      for a few days on AOL servers before &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/ptech/03/15/gnutella/"&gt;disappearing&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#160;The
      technology being gnutella is quite interesting. Instead of relying on a central server
      to advertise files the user is sharing, the connection to a gnutella network is quite
      different: 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The
      first step is to connect to the network. Because there is no server, the client must
      find a new IP address to connect to. This is the &lt;b&gt;bootstrap&lt;/b&gt; stage. In the first
      few days of gnutella, this meant going on IRC, asking for an IP, and try connecting.
      Later on, each software vendor established their own public IP to let people connect
      faster. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Once
      you&amp;#8217;re connected, you send a search. Your search is just a string, and is sent
      to the computer you&amp;#8217;re connected to. This computer sends you back the list of
      files containing the string, and forward your request to all the computers it&amp;#8217;s
      connected to, which in turn reply and forward. This method is called a &lt;b&gt;broadcast&lt;/b&gt;,
      and was the most common operation on the network, and the one taking up most of the
      bandwidth users had. Your search was forwarded to a maximum of 7 hops, which meant
      quite a lot of computers. The network data contained two counts, TTL for time to live,
      and HOPS for the number of computers already seen. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When
      you wanted to download a file, you connected &lt;b&gt;out of band&lt;/b&gt; using HTTP to the
      other computer having the file. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      The software used to connect to the gnutella network was named a &lt;b&gt;servent&lt;/b&gt;, a
      contraction of server and client. The big deal here is that everything was running
      without a central server, without a central authority, and without any form of potential
      failure point. The network was bootstrapped, autonomous and living a life on its own. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      When I joined the gnutella community, in late march 2000, I met a lot of people, mainly
      on IRC. These people were both very smart, dedicated, and willing to move things forward.
      Let&amp;#8217;s face it, the first releases of the gnutella software from nullsoft was
      crap. Ugly, not working, had bugs, etc. And there was no reason to call it gnu as
      the source code was absolutely not open source. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      The people I met started deciphering the gnutella network protocol, which was a fast
      and easy process considering the very low complexity of the data structures. I even
      wrote a client in VB at the time, just for fun. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      After just a few weeks of dicussing mainly with Gene Khan, which took upon himself
      to be the contact point for anything gnutella related in the world, and with people
      such as Ben Houston, a few things were very apparent: 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Information
      on the current gnutella protocol was sparse, developers were missing a place to discuss
      about the current technology to implement their own software. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;People
      needed a place to ask questions such as &amp;#8220;What is the IP address&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;Where
      can I download a client&amp;#8221;. Newbie&amp;#8217;s questions. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'&gt;
      &lt;span style='font-family: Symbol'&gt;&amp;middot;&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;The
      gnutella protocol sucked and badly needed to be replaced / extended. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      So in April, we split the gnutella IRC forum and web site in three. One, gnutella,
      would be the PR group, and handling all the public (understand not developers) questions.
      The second, gnutella-dev, would help the developers&amp;#8217; community to implement
      the gnutella protocol and behavior recommendations, to help create more software using
      gnutella. The third one, gnutella-ng, was the place where we were supposed to create
      a new gnutella protocol, erasing what mistakes we did in the past, while reusing the
      concepts of gnutella, to create a better world. I was the main architect of all these
      changes, and only took gnutella-ng in hands. Gene was keeping gnutella, and gnutella-dev
      was to be very open to anyone. I&amp;#8217;m afraid I don&amp;#8217;t remember who was in
      charge of it. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      All these web sites were handled on wego.com. &lt;a href="http://gnutellang.wego.com/"&gt;http://gnutellang.wego.com&lt;/a&gt; won&amp;#8217;t
      get you very far, but once upon a time, it was a very busy web site. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;Continued in part 2, soon.&lt;/i&gt; 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#160; 
   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      Am finishing my Task based MVC modifications to the excellent User Interface Process
      today, and here is one thing that comes over and over in my code. This pattern is
      absolutely frightening. Let&amp;#8217;s go through it together: 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;div style="BORDER-RIGHT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-RIGHT: 4pt; BORDER-TOP: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-LEFT: 4pt; BACKGROUND: #ffff99; PADDING-BOTTOM: 1pt; BORDER-LEFT: windowtext 1pt solid; PADDING-TOP: 1pt; BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid; mso-element: para-border-div"&gt;
      &lt;p class=MsoNormal style="BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; PADDING-RIGHT: 0cm; BORDER-TOP: medium none; PADDING-LEFT: 0cm; BACKGROUND: #ffff99; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0cm; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; PADDING-TOP: 0cm; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none"&gt;
         &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: blue"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: blue"&gt;sealed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;&lt;span style="COLOR: blue"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt; DumbFactory&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
         &lt;span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; {&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

         cache pattern and dual lock volatile pattern, all at the same time :)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

         tasks;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;
      No new posts tonight. Scoble talked about it a while back, but when life becomes busy,
      things have a tendancy to go bad, especially if they can. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      Being a geek, I&amp;rsquo;m working on Longhorn. I have side projects which sucks a lot
      of my coding time already. My day work is exhaustingly linear in the amount of coding
      I do. I also have a family life. Here is my schedule: 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      &amp;#160; 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; 7,
      wake up. Try to. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; 8
      wake up, really. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; 9,
      at work up and running 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; 11,

      dinner. After that, movie. No choice here, it&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;right thing to do&amp;rdquo;
      to get your half off your toes 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; 23:00,
      try to catch up on blogs, newsgroups, and code 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; Now,
      here, depends on a lot of factors. You can get into troubles and have a few fights
      with your half about your so called lack of attention (even though you&amp;rsquo;re paying
      for both and working 10 hours a day to get more money home, sacrifice your week ends
      and most of your coding time, just to be able to keep a survivable standard for the
      household while you&amp;rsquo;re the only one with a job). 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1'&gt;&lt;![if !supportLists]&gt;
      &lt;span style='mso-list:Ignore'&gt;-&lt;span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'&gt;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;![endif]&gt; So
      tonight I was heading to bed, but after not going to bed exactly 10 seconds after
      my half stood up to get there, fight. I&amp;rsquo;m in no mood to go to bed now. But I&amp;rsquo;m
      tired, so I&amp;rsquo;ll go anyway. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      Boring kind of &amp;ldquo;how a busy life can suck up most of your joy&amp;rdquo; on a depressive
      night. 
   &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;
      How do married geeks out there can handle that kind of situations? Comments welcomed.&amp;#160; 
   &lt;/p&gt;

         about the BitVector32 class being buggy. My main problem was that it was not feature
         complete, and I still had to rely on a lot of bit shifting, which is, for people like
         me, very error prone. Associated with a good code generator, this class is a perfect
         tool to build UNION like structures in .net without relying on the marshaling classes.

         Roy mentions that I should mention the bug in the original implementation:

            <em>"<font size="2">the indexer always returns false for bit #31"</font></em>

            <font size="2">While this problem in itself would have been enough to rewrite the
         original code, you'll see that my API is really different. My main problem was to
         be able to deal with different types (a 3bits value, 3 bools as bits, and all the
         awful things C++ developers just writing their structs on a network pipe make us,
         poor .net people without a UNION thing, incapable of handling).

        <p>
      To answer <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=33f50d62-4ff7-4750-b6bc-535621b8dca1">this </a>from
      Scott, let me tell you my story.
   </p>
        <p>
      Any day at any new project coding session. Meeting for an hour or two with R&amp;D
      to understand what they want. This is the moment I suffer the most in my work. I've
      worked as a contractor before, and the beauty of this job is that you really need
      to understand what the guy in front of you wants to <strong>accomplish</strong>. You
      have to understand what he needs, so you have to understand his work. Up to the point
      where you can do it instead of him (which most of the time is the case as, once your
      software is done, the guy just use it to do the job). But you know this is only the
      tip of the iceberg. You can start feeling the coldness of the diagrams flowing through
      your body.
   </p>
        <p>
      Back to the desk. Pen, paper, Brahms in the ears, tell anyone not to disturb for an
      hour. You know you'll need more, but you also know it will be some kind of a stress
      relief when you'll tell them to go away in an hour. And start sketching.
   </p>
        <p>
      No no, don't start with a very clear diagram. You know your head is not working like
      that. Graphically design the result data, and try to make some sense of it. Add a
      lot of boring stuff and design 100 SQL tables to comply with what you have in mind,
      your grand scheme. You know, that killer uber application that is supposed to be released
      5 years ago.
   </p>
        <p>
      Draw again, now talking in C#. This is thrilling, you get one class right. You can
      feel the pressure, because you know you have a beginning. And you start sketching
      more and more. You build carefully your whole system in your head, you see classes,
      runtime instances, planets, all turning around a big XML document being married to
      an XSD Schema by Don Box wearing a Yellow suit (don't ask me why).
   </p>
        <p>
      And then, disaster. You missed a small piece. And <strong>this</strong> is the moment
      where you start being insane. You know you missed something so fundamental (in your
      eyes) that you're going to have to rewrite most of your code. But remember, at this
      point you have no code, which is even more frightening. You thought you were handling
      it quite close, and it went away. <strong>This</strong> is where the dilemma starts.
      Hack away a quick solution and think about it for the later release of the product?
      Or redesign everything again? Please note this only happens when :
   </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
         The full binary is scheduled for last week</li>
          <li>
         Your manager doesn't want to wait because a director promised the feature would be
         there without asking anyone before hand if it was even feasible</li>
          <li>
         It's raining outside, you're cold, the heater in the office is off, you forgot to
         buy cigarettes and there's no coffee or Redbull near you</li>
          <li>
         Don Box is wearing a yellow suit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
      This is where most developers / architects enter an introspection phase. You stop
      shaving, you spend all your time drawing on a tabletPC or a drawing board. You talk
      to yourself while walking around the office, whispering things like "This class must
      not be responsible for that, because if it does, the other class doesn't have control
      of the execution graph".
   </p>
        <p>
      This is when you get home. And this is when you hear : "Honey, you know, if they don't
      care, why do you? And if you don't shave that beard, you sleep on the sofa!".
   </p>
        <p>
      This is what leads you to either of the following solution:
   </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
         After this whole week / month / year / product cycle, you decide to cut off your requirements,
         hack something for the client and go to bed</li>
          <li>
         This electric shock treatment hurts your brain, which starts drawing a full schema
         of the whole architecture in your head, as clear as a sun in the night. In that case,
         you don't go to bed, but you can make up for it the next day.</li>
        </ol>

      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2003 00:22:30 GMT</pubDate>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
   To answer &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=33f50d62-4ff7-4750-b6bc-535621b8dca1"&gt;this &lt;/a&gt;from
   Scott, let me tell you my story.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Any day at any new project coding session. Meeting for an hour or two with R&amp;amp;D
   to understand what they want. This is the moment I suffer the most in my work. I've
   worked as a contractor before, and the beauty of this job is that you really need
   to understand what the guy in front of you wants to &lt;strong&gt;accomplish&lt;/strong&gt;. You
   have to understand what he needs, so you have to understand his work. Up to the point
   where you can do it instead of him (which most of the time is the case as, once your
   software is done, the guy just use it to do the job). But you know this is only the
   tip of the iceberg. You can start feeling the coldness of the diagrams flowing through
   your body.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Back to the desk. Pen, paper, Brahms in the ears, tell anyone not to disturb for an
   hour. You know you'll need more, but you also know it will be some kind of a stress
   relief when you'll tell them to go away in an hour. And start sketching.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   No no, don't start with a very clear diagram. You know your head is not working like
   that. Graphically design the result data, and try to make some sense of it. Add a
   lot of boring stuff and design 100 SQL tables to comply with what you have in mind,
   your grand scheme. You know, that killer uber application that is supposed to be released
   5 years ago.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Draw again, now talking in C#. This is thrilling, you get one class right. You can
   feel the pressure, because you know you have a beginning. And you start sketching
   more and more. You build carefully your whole system in your head, you see classes,
   runtime instances, planets, all turning around a big XML document being married to

      My office. As you can see, my <a href="http://www-132.ibm.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CategoryDisplay?catalogId=-840&amp;storeId=1&amp;langId=-1&amp;dualCurrId=73&amp;categoryId=2072541">IBM
      T30 </a>has a dual screen Radeon video card. I was a bit surprised that Black
      n White is actually running quite well on it.
   </p>
        <p align="left">
      The second screen is a SyncMaster 171s, a 17" flat that we were given. Quite nice,
      although I must say I'm getting used to the high resolution of the laptop.
   </p>
        <p align="left">
      The third screen, well, I'm a bit cheating there. It's not a third screen, but my
      windows 2003 test box (the one having the test server and the auto build system).
      I use a MK named <a href="http://synergy2.sourceforge.net">Synergy </a>to move only
      my main keyboard and mouse around. This tool won my "geek trophy" weekly contest.
   </p>
        <p align="left">
      Frankly, a 3 21" LCD configuration would be ideal for me (that is, 3 1600 * 1200 screens),
      in high resolution it would be even better. I still have to find any video card supporting
      more than 2 DVI outputs though. Anyone?

      I've read quite a lot of bloggers (<a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/seichert/posts/3420.aspx">here </a>for
      example) complaining about removing records from their test database.
   </p>
        <p>
      Most of them go through some of the nifty SQL features that are VERY VERY VERY handy.
      How about this, you prepare your database, and save it as an mdb file... That, for
      example, you include as a resource in your preferred source control system.
   </p>
        <p>
      Then, when testing your file, you copy it, and in your unit test, you use the following
      connection string in SqlClient:
   </p>
        <p>
          <em>Initial File Name="YourPath:\YourFile.mdb"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
      Then you can discard your whole file after working on it. As simple as you can get.

            <strong>Services share schema and contract, not class</strong>
            <br />
         This is not entirely true, and proves to be completely wrong. RSS specs are not
         XSD compliant, and on the other side of the pipe, XML-RPC is not schema based. It
         is actually far far from it. 
      </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service policy is determined based on policy</strong>
            <br />
         Real validation of RSS feeds can't really be expressed by XSD, and RSS is not even
         an infoset by it's lack of namespaces and extensibility points (Dave Winer might say
         something different, but...) 
      </li>
          <li>
         Boundaries are explicit<br />
         Which boundaries are explicit between user authentication, posting, reading, commenting,
         track-backing, pinging, etc?

        </ul>
        <p>
      The fact is, for a blog to be considered SOA, you need a two way channel, which is
      autonomous, and has a clear way of communication, in a message oriented way. Atom
      is a good step in that direction. But no, dasBlog is not yet an SOA :)

      Richard <a href="http://www.tallent.us/PermaLink.aspx?guid=153acbd9-1dbf-4e87-8a4f-d08c46e4db79 ">answers </a>to
      my <a href="http://www.tallent.us/CommentView.aspx?guid=3678ccf3-b97e-448a-a37b-165aae89bc16">comment</a> to
      his web site about the IDE of the future, and more specifically the XAML way of coding.
   </p>
        <p>
      Richard has a great overview of mixing different languages in the IDE, letting you
      write your code using "sections" which could be written in c#, vb, regex, uml or whatever,
      as integrated snippets. While I do agree developers, as we move forward, need to know
      a wide range of languages (C#, regular expressions, UML, XSD, XPath and XQuery, SQL,
      etc), and that encapsulating cross technologies in strings is inherently a bad thing,
      i strongly believe that code separation is the only way to achieve it reasonably.
      Just imagine the problems involved in having a graphics designer embed in code.
   </p>
        <p>
      Building on the principle I talked about in my comment, each language has a specific
      Role. XAML is used as a descriptive language to initialize object graphs, Regex is
      used specifically for text processing, etc. The current IDEs don't deliver on this
      integration.
   </p>
        <p>
      Yes you should be able to have one file written in c#, the other in vb, and the third
      being a dtq file providing a GUI on an SQL query. And all these should be able to
      reference and use each others inside the same project.
   </p>
        <p>
      Richard says <em>"ASP.NET with a code-behind VB file with a bunch of business logic
      is every bit as messy and wrong as one of those old VB6 projects we've all probably
      had to deal with.",</em> but also says <em>"Why not just have a richer IDE document
      window that can take on all of the code that code into a class and view each piece
      in the ways that make sense to the programmer?".</em> (Anyone interested in the discussion
      is strongly advised to go and read the entry I'm talking about, you need to get the
      whole picture to rely on my quotes).
   </p>
        <p>
      Now, what is different between the two approaches? My opinion on the matter is that
      they both end up in clutter. If I start writing my code using T-SQL, XQuery, C# and
      Perl.net code in the same file, using different views in the same document interface,
      I end up leaving a legacy the next developer might not be able to deal with. The reality
      is that, although in my team I'm very proficient in all of these languages, most of
      my colleagues deal with half of it. As a team, they can manage and rely on each others
      if I leave the code to them. The reality is that as much as each of these languages
      are very efficient for one <em>domain</em>, most developers can't handle all of these
      languages.
   </p>
        <p>
      The last part of the discussion is the most interesting IMO. Richard talks about a
      visual designer being an <em>Interface</em> to a language, and the code view being
      another. I can't agree more. But I can't agree on the systematic comparison with winforms,
      which are an anomaly of the IDE. The visual designer tries to spit code and tries
      to rely on it when showing the designer. This is the wrong approach, because you tightly
      couple the designer with the underlying code being generated, which can change. Layer
      separation is not the problem here, Domain separation is. The real <strong>mistake</strong> is
      trying to add these interfaces on languages that can't cope with it. Forms generated
      code is akward, unmaintainable, requires the specific designer to work with, and can
      be broken badly. Typed Datasets are the exact same problem, because you rely on code
      being generated from one language which, in itself, is sufficient, to a language which
      is not domain specific to your concern. writing an XSD in C# is absurd and you should
      not rely on it. dtq files are the right way to go, if only they were actually usable
      from your code project, which is not the case today.
   </p>
        <p>
      Forms have a few interesting properties. First, there's a layout and a style. XAML
      provides for a clean separation of concerns, by providing a view on these aspects
      of the design. This let a graphical designer modify the layout, style, etc, without
      risking changing code. He can then work more efficiently with the developer, as he's
      not tied to code generation. Integrating vectors in a form, 3d animations, can all
      be done without the developer investing too much of it's time making sure the designer
      doesn't break anything. This is the principle of domain separation.
   </p>
        <p>
      If you work a bit on the MVC patterns, especially things like the User Interface Process
      Application Block, you will see an approach where the form, the XAML document you
      are talking about, have properties and methods that deal with layout. They also have
      methods that deal with navigations, and to follow the domain separation mantra, we
      use a controller to know which intelligence to do with what the form came with. These
      controllers are the ones being notified of something to be done, and can do it efficiently.
   </p>
        <p>
      MVC is a pattern that is not widely used in .net, much more in Java. If used <strong>intelligently</strong>,
      you can get a lot from it, increasing code maintainability, separation of concerns,
      and team work. XAML adds a new separation because there's a need: The typical developer
      can't deal with providing fancy graphics and vectors. That's the sad sad reality,
      I'm bad at including any grpahics element to an app, that's why I rely on a designer.
      XAML provides for a separation in the view between the declarative layout, the layout
      interaction which can be implemented in code behind. Add MVC and you have a great
      way to work as a team.

      Today was the big installation day. I didn't want to suffer the performance problems
      of running Longhorn under a virtual PC or a VMware installation, so I started by repartitionning
      my main hard drive using the fabulous Partition Magic 8 (<a href="http://www.powerquest.com">http://www.powerquest.com</a>),
      and gave Longhorn a nice 20 gigs to play around. I can as such use the full power
      of my GeForce 4 and my Athlon. Went smoothly, Partition magic reboots the computer
      and create the second primary partition. So far so good.
   </p>
        <p>
      The next step is pretty easy: from my original windowsXP OS, launch the install. No
      bootable CD, no iso files to play around with. Copy the files in a folder on Windows,
      and start the setup.exe from there.
   </p>
        <p>
      A few comments on these early steps:

      <title>First installation</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;
   Today was the big installation day. I didn't want to suffer the performance problems
   of running Longhorn under a virtual PC or a VMware installation, so I started by repartitionning
   my main hard drive using the fabulous Partition Magic 8 (&lt;a href="http://www.powerquest.com"&gt;http://www.powerquest.com&lt;/a&gt;),
   and gave Longhorn a nice 20 gigs to play around. I can as such use the full power
   of my GeForce&amp;nbsp;4 and my Athlon. Went smoothly, Partition magic reboots the computer
   and create the second primary partition. So far so good.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   The next step is pretty easy: from my original windowsXP OS, launch the install. No
   bootable CD, no iso files to play around with. Copy the files in a folder on Windows,
   and start the setup.exe from there.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   A few comments on these early steps:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;
      The graphics of the installer are... Messy at best. Really wierd. 
   &lt;li&gt;
      There's a bug in the installation where, if you try to run it from a path with spaces
      in its name, it won't start. 
   &lt;li&gt;
      There's no choice on start up for the keyboard language; That's a bit annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Other than that, the install starts, and reboot 3 or 4 times. Not a long waiting,
   and when I got back from dinner (I must say I was a bit afraid from what I read in
   the blogs) the computer&amp;nbsp;was ready.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   A few things are annoying, upon the first reboot, the gradiant filling&amp;nbsp;of the
   setup is really messy, it doesn't look good. But on a bright side, both of my screens
   were recognized.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Now my first complaint. It's been what, a few years since flat panels and svga cards
   are available. Microsoft, this is for you. Get us a loader with hi res graphics; Get
   us rich medias on startup; And RECOGNIZE the resolution supported by screens and video
   cards. Can't be that hard! And that's something I'm really missing from BeOS!
&lt;/p&gt;

      Christian Weyer gives us a very handy tool to experiment with the concept of contract
      first web services.
   </p>
        <p>
      For those of you not yet hooked up on the latest WS - SOA trends, we are moving to
      the idea of a contract being an agreement between endpoints to establish a communication.
      Instead of saying:
   </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
         We've been raised in the same school (Type), so we can communciate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
      We now say:
   </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
         We speak the same language (Contract), so we can communicate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
      The shift is important for interop, and can resolve partly the biggest problems with
      versioning and other advanced problems. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a good
      step.
   </p>
        <p>
      Indigo supports this idea, but this add-in gives you a way to create your contract
      first, and to get the code after. This is important because, in the SOA model, Object
      Oriented methodologies are only use within the boundaries of your service, which you
      can access from the outside world only through the contract.
   </p>
        <p>
      Yeah, I know, boring explanation, here is the link, enjoy.

      You know how it is, you start writing a huge entry, then midlessly click and bam,
      you loose your blog entry. How <strong>frustrating</strong>. One more reason to drop
      the browser completely and shift to a new <u><font color="#ff0000">paradigm</font></u>.

      In the meantime, you'll have to wait till tonight for me to post anything interesting

   the browser completely and shift to a new &lt;u&gt;&lt;font color=#ff0000&gt;paradigm&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   In the meantime, you'll have to wait till tonight for me to post anything interesting
   :)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
   Oh, yeah, don't consider that to be my first post, just my post 0. (I live in a c#
   woooooooorld).
